He wanted to gain more power and decided to work in the National Assembly. Now, he is the chief aide to a 4-time lawmaker. He has excellent intuition, a cold-blooded decisiveness and a strong desire to win. He was able to place his lawmaker in the position of the party representative, but Jang Tae-Joon has higher ambitions. Meanwhile Kang Sun-Young is a first year lawmaker who got elected through proportional representation and is a spokesperson for her party. She worked as a lawyer and hosted a current affairs TV program prior to becoming a lawmaker. She is ambitious and does her job well. Kang Sun-Young has an awkward relationship with Jang Tae-Joon, whose boss is a rival of the senior lawmaker who got her to become proportional representation lawmaker.

This is the last part of the review series. I planned to put this out way earlier but due to family events and sickness, the last part took me a long time to write. For this part, the rules of which dramas were eligible for review might seem arbitrary, but they are necessary. Since I decided upon only sticking to the first half, any series that was not finished before the halfway point of 2019 (July 1), I won’t be reviewing in this series. Perhaps I will talk about them some other time but for now let’s stick to the five dramas in the title of the post. \\n\\nFor additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.\\n\\nAs usual, let\\'s get started!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**May and June**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Secret Life of My Secretary - SBS**\\n\\nA romcom drama about a director at a telecom company who develops face-blindness and the only one whom he recognizes is his secretary.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:* \\n\\n(1) The show is campy in the best way possible. To truly understand why this drama works, we need to talk about the element of camp. A piece of media being described as “campy” indicates that it is ridiculous and over the top in a way that is cheesy but it’s sometimes tacky taste and ironic value is what makes it enjoyable. So many things in this drama are very over the top, but that just adds to the campiness of the show. The show also dips into being a genre parody, which I find hilarious. Whether or not the campiness and parody-like moments are intentional or not is up for debate, but I consider the show to be rather self aware.\\n\\n(2) Kim Jae Kyung as Veronica Park, the CEO of a giant film company, is just such a hoot. Now some may say that the character Veronica Park is just Jun Ji Hyun’s Cheon Song Yi from You Who Came From The Stars on way too much caffeine, but I’d like to think that she is a pretty good joke/comic relief character on top of having a fair number of pretty human and relatable moments. Veronica Park is meant to be a character that is half parody and half serious. For the most part, she is hilarious and even has some elaborate jokes in the show. One such example is her showing her powers of telling when a movie is supposed to do well in the box office and then dissing Train to Busan saying it’s going to be a failure was hysterical. However, she also has her scenes where she shows off her insecurities which affect her character as well, which made me connect with her more than just as a comic relief. \\n\\n(3) The genre parody moments had me rolling.For instance, having cherry blossom petals and raining falling at the same on the main couples first date had me rolling. On top of that, we also got other cliché happenings accompanying the main couple for their such as bubbles, fireworks, more rain, falling stars, you name it. They through the romantic effects “kitchen sink” at the viewer and it ends up being really funny in a tongue-in-cheek way.\\n\\nOther things that are supposed to be romantic also end up being comedic, and I kind of love that. Such as Min Ik putting her hands in his armpits to warm them up. Like I get that it seems sweet but I know how sweaty your armpits get in a three piece suit. Once again, I’m not sure if this was intended to be a genre parody or not, but I choose to view it as such.\\n\\n(4) There are some pretty sick shots in the drama as well, believe it or not. There is a shot in the office of the male lead, Do Min Ik played by Kim Young Kwang, that was made to look like it was filmed from within the aquarium was so sick. I got surprised when suddenly a fish entered the frame and then it hit me. That shot showed some really creative thinking on the directors part. I would guess that was done by filming the fish from the outside, mirroring the picture and then putting it as the outward most layer on top of the regular angle shot. I could be wrong though. Still impressed that they decided to experiment a bit with the cinematography without it becoming overbearing. \\n\\n(5) Despite how light hearted the drama is, it actually has some heavier moments as well that hit me harder than I would have expected. The female lead, Jung Gal Hee played by Jin Ki Joo, doesn’t have an easy life and the actress really sells that as well. Her crying plays with your heart just as much as all the sweet moments between the two leads with all the “lovey dovey”-ness that is in their eyes. Probably the peak of emotional moments for me is &gt;!the rooftop scene where Min Ik and Gal Hee have their first kiss. She knows that kissing him under the pretense of being Veronica Park is bad and even says to herself and her dead mother after giving in to her own desires: “I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to die young since that is the only way that I’ll get to see you again, But now, I don’t think I will ever be able to see you again. I might not be able to up to where you are”.!&lt; Personally, this hit me like a truck as I thought it was a really powerful and human statement. Through this it has become clear that Gal Hee decided she will no longer live for someone else, but instead live for herself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\nAs the drama becomes very enjoyable because of its campy nature, there are a lot of flaws that comes from being a cheese fest as well. \\n\\n(1) The show requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, as the whole set up of the drama relies on the male lead being a clueless fool once he gets hit with facial blindness. This guy who was a master at picking up social clues before being hit with facial blindness, suddenly becomes inept at sensing in someone’s voice when they are crying right in front of him and also can’t recognize the female lead’s voice or mannerisms even though they spend almost every waking hour together. As a viewer, these kinds of issues are just something you’ll have to turn a blind eye on. \\n\\n(2) The stunts are certainly not within the expectations of visual media in the 21st century at all. In the second episode a character is seen falling from a building. In the first shot of the scene, the speed, angle and manner the character falls in makes it very obvious that they used wires to make sure the person stops about halfway from the ground. Also, in my humble opinion, using wires looks worse than having someone someone falling onto a mat because of the risk of looking fake. Thankfully, they at least edited out the wires with a film processing software. In the next shot, the character is seen from above falling towards the ground and the green screen effect used here to simulate that the character is indeed falling and not acting standing in front a green screen is terrible. I’ve seen youtubers make better green screen effects than this. The perspective of the scenery in the effect makes it obvious that the background is indeed 2d and not 3d.\\n\\n(3) There are other effects that are really cheesy and low effort as well, like showing a star falling on the night sky when there is no context of why they would show that shot at all and the effect doesn’t even look good. The exposure of the shot is way off considering that they are showing a Seoul skyline filled with bright lights and somehow a falling star manages to be spotted yet even brighter than the city lights. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,5 / 10* \\\\- It’s a pretty cliché and cheesy drama, but it is quite self aware and that makes it okay in my book. I think it’s strengths outweighs it flaws which makes it far from great but extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Abyss - TvN**\\n\\nA fantasy crime drama about a mysterious object who can revive people, both good and bad, and a group of people who try to stop a serial killer.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) The Metamorphosis reference and parallels. In one scene, we see the antagonist Oh Yeong Cheol reading “The Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka in a café. This gives us some insight on his ideology. Much like the father in “The Metamorphosis” he believes that every person who is useless to him in this world is as good as an insect, and deserving of being beaten until they either serve his purposes or die.\\n\\nThis also gives some foreshadowing to the rest of the drama, as “The Metamorphosis” is commonly seen as an outlet for Kafka to write about &gt;!his own father issues and how his abusive father shaped him into what he became. The same goes for Seo Ji Wook played by Kwon Soo Hyun. His experiences with his own abusive father largely has turned him into the person he is today.!&lt;\\n\\n“The Metamorphosis” is also commonly seen as not only a story about a man transforming into a vermin, but also the story of a girl transforming into a woman as the sister of the main character of the novel, makes her own journey to womanhood. &gt;!This can also be said for Hee Jin played by Han So Hee who goes from being quite immature to morphing into a responsible woman.   !&lt;\\n\\n(2) Ahn Hyo Seop sounds really good when he is speaking in foreign languages which is very in character for Cha Min. This is rather rare in a kdrama so I found this impressive. Even if the actor is not fluent like Ahn Hyo Seop, there is no shame in dubbing an actor who can’t speak a language when you want to convey the image of a professional who is fluent in several languages. I wish more kdramas would do this instead of having them speak poor English/French/Russian/Chinese/Japanese etc. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with speaking with a heavy accent. Speaking a language with a heavy accent is perfect if it fits the character, but when it doesn’t fit the character it definitely breaks the immersion for the viewer.\\n\\n(3) Park Bo Young’s acting, man, it’s so good. If I compare it with her other two latest dramas, Oh My Ghostess and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, I think the one thing that she has gotten a lot better at is her comedic timing. She has truly evolved that part of her repertoire which results in some truly hilarious moments that otherwise would have fell flat if her delivery wasn’t so on point.\\n\\n(4) The soundtrack is nice. The OST list is not very extensive but the tracklist with songs by Suran, Coogie, Kim Feel and Kim Bohyung still remains memorable and suits the different moments of the show well. \\n\\n(5) For the most part, the drama is well shot. In particular, I really like the crane shots that they use pretty sparingly but to great effect for showing perspective in wide shots and establishing frames. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) The director and writer takes a little too much influence from mediocre horror movies. It becomes apparent through the use of sudden noises and horror movie music which leads into a lot of fake outs just to get a reaction out of the audience. Another aspect of the mediocre horror movie influences is that everyone who is not a villain in this series makes stupid and irrational decisions constantly. Much like the cast of a slasher or a horror film characters don’t even try to run or survive, they willingly go to secluded areas with a person they know is a murderer and prove themselves to be too stupid to live. The purpose of a lot of characters is just to die, which is just horrible writing.\\n\\n(2) There is way too much time wasted with recycled scenes and footage. The reason you would do this is to fill the runtime while spending less money. For example, they spent 14 minutes in Episode 5 just recapping the previous episode and showing some additional scenes that didn’t contain any additional plot information. Those are 14 minutes of air time wasted. They could have just extended the previous episode by 5 minutes to fit in those extra scenes.\\n\\n(3) What is up with the focus in certain shots? For the most part, it’s all right, but sometimes they either shift focus too quickly which results in a blurry mess or the characters who should be emphasised in the frame are out of focus where the camera is focused on something irrelevant in either the foreground or the background. They rarely use the blurry focus for the purpose of achieving a cool shot or a certain effect. It’s just poor camera work. \\n\\n(4) For a show about a supernatural orb that can bring people back to life, there is very unimaginative writing to go along with it. Rather than using the orb as a way of writing interesting plotlines, they just go about things in the exact same way that a non-supernatural show would go about things. For example,&gt;! instead of having to write in a female accomplice that shows up disguise as a cop to help Oh Yeong Cheol to escape from prison, how cool would it have been if he schemed his way out of prison by using the mechanics of the Abyss? !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Speaking of which, they made the mechanics of the Abyss way less interesting than they could have been. Instead of having the Abyss be able to switch between users when they die like a daisy chain to the next person who was revived after they were. Instead they decided to put a limitation on it returning it to the original users if a new user dies, resulting in way less interesting possibilities for the writers to integrate the Abyss in changing the plot.!&lt;\\n\\n(5) There is a clear disconnect between Ahn Se Ha and Ahn Hyo Seop as well as Kim Sa Ra and Park Bo Young. They don’t feel like they are the same character in different bodies, as their mannerisms, expressions and to an extent personalities are completely different after the transformation. Compared to another body switching drama of this year, Spring Turns to Spring, that drama executes this aspect way better than Abyss.\\n\\n(6) Making a story about the superficiality in South Korea and the modern world as a whole is not a new concept in kdrama but it’s a topic that I still feel is pretty fresh, but the execution is not very good and they don’t touch on the topic other than at surface level. It also doesn’t help that the drama reinforces unrealistic beauty standards for both men and women as the drama indirectly tells you that if you look like Ahn Se Ha, then you are an ugly guy and if you look worse than Park Bo Young then you are a below-average looking girl. However, I realise everything has a context and that this is dramaland and if you don’t have a conventionally attractive lead, the drama is not going to do as well.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 4,0 / 10* \\\\- Cool concept and good acting but the writing is abysmal to the point where it ruins the drama completely. \\n\\n \\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Save Me 2 - OCN**\\n\\nA psychological mystery drama about people living in a village that is about to be made into a reservoir and a fake religious group looking to scam the villagers of everything they got.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) Although this is a setup heavy drama, the setup is rather well executed. It is never confusing or vague, yet the foreshadowing and hints don’t become so obvious it’s patronizing.  There is a great eye for detail throughout the drama. For instance, when they were building the church and they installed a ramp to the altar stage I wondered what that is for and a couple of episodes later it becomes apparent that Elder Choi had a thought behind even such a small background detail. Good job and coordination by the writer and the set designer to make this line up. \\n\\n(2) I really like the lighting of the drama. In the daylight scenes, the colors are quite dusty and washed out. As a juxtaposition, the night time scenes uses the very commonly used color palette of orange and teal (or alternatively red and blue). Although the aforementioned color scheme is used often (especially in Hollywood), I think there is good reason for it. The main reason is because these colors are complimentary colors that create a lot of contrast between each other while at the same time highlighting the human skin in the best way possible. \\n\\n(3) The locations feel unique and authentic. With so many dramas taking place in the glitzy big city, it is refreshing to see a drama take place in the countryside and in run down small towns. It’s not a glamorous setting, but it helps us understand the simple lives that most of the cast are living.\\n\\n(4) Best anti-hero protagonist of the year so far. Kim Min Cheol is a real menace. He is not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination and he is not supposed to be one either. Although he is not the most law abiding citizen, he still has some good to him and stands up for the ones he cares about. To add on to his already rough and intimidating persona is the voice of Uhm Tae Goo which sounds like he has been eating razor blades for breakfast every morning. I love it.\\n\\n(5) I really enjoy the way they portray the individual and group psychology throughout the show. It gives pretty good insight into why people would join a cult, how people deal with pain and loss as well as how effective having a common enemy is for building a strong group.\\n\\n(6) Some of the fighting scenes look really solidly choreographed and you can really feel the impact of them. I like how sluggish Min Cheol’s fighting is, as he is far removed from his days as a martial artist and deals entirely with street brawls nowadays. I actually caught myself flinching at how hard hitting the violence is at points with how painful some blows look and how crunchy the sound is from the impacts. This is how I like my violence, not clean and polished but really raw-looking without exaggerating the gore. I think this approach is less about glorifying or making light of violence but instead showing how ugly it can really be.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) I know this is a preferential thing, like I’ve stated before these are just my takes not hard facts, but there is too much shaky cam being used in certain scenes to achieve a sense of urgency. It doesn’t help either that they often use zoom when executing a shaky cam sequence either. For me as a viewer, it just creates this effect of nausea. I mean it’s fine if you want to use it to indicate that a person is shaking someone, but then they should stabilize it once the person stops and not continue with the handheld shaky cam. That just comes of like they couldn’t plant a tripod in that spot and they didn’t have a chest rig on set.\\n\\n(2) The story takes so long to get going as it is a very set up heavy drama like mentioned earlier. About half the drama is just set up for the major plot events of the second half, so the first half might feel like a bit of a slog, especially if you were to binge watch the show. In my opinion, the all the set up is worth the pay off and the set up is even quite entertaining to watch. However, I can see why this kind of a threshold is off-putting to some. I suspect that this issue is a result of being an adaptation of the 2013 animated film “The Fake”. Stretching the plot from a 2 hour film to a 16 hour drama does usually come with some growing pains.\\n\\n(3) The portrayal of religious belief and religious people is not very nuanced. If that is what you are looking for, than this drama is probably not what you are after as religion is merely painted as evil. The spiritual leaders are portrayed as being all evil and selfish and the believers are portrayed as fools. Although I am not one bit sympathetic to the acts of religious cults around the world, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced picture painted by showing the positive sides of religion and contrasting the schemes of madmen with the strength that can be granted from healthy theology.\\n\\n(4) OCN dramas needs to give their special effects department a bigger budget. This is not the first time where a drama of theirs has had really poor special effects. The biggest offense is as usual fire. It becomes so apparent when they use CGI fire instead of real fire, that I can’t focus on anything else than the fake flames in what is supposed to be a serious scene.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,5 / 10* \\\\- This drama is definitely a grower and it’s a drama that requires a fair bit of patience but if you are willing to put the time into it there are a lot of factors that makes Save Me 2 an enjoyable show.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Voice 3: City of Accomplices - OCN**\\n\\nCrime thriller with sci-fi elements about a call center team trying to hunt down an illegal cartel ran through the dark web.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) The production value has gone way up since earlier seasons, especially since season 1. It’s more well shot than ever before. The reason for this can partially be attributed to the director changing every season and for season 3 they brought in the director of Tunnel, which bumped up the direction quality a fair bit. No longer do I have to suffer through camera shadows showing in some shots, which really breaks immersion for the viewer. \\n\\nThe quality has also increased in the prop and editing department. They stepped up their blood game. In earlier seasons, the blood has been really poor looking overall. Whenever they decided to use digital blood, it looked absolutely atrocious and the times when there was writing in blood the fake blood prop was way off in texture and color and ended up looking like regular paint. They have now eliminated those problems in the third season. The special effects makeup has also gotten better. Now, the viewer doesn’t have to look at the edge of the silicon that they used to recreate a wound flapping about. Also, the sound effects work has gotten better. A knife being waved about in midair now sounds like it should (“swoosh swoosh”) and doesn’t make stabbing sounds (“schlink schlink”) indicating that the metal is making contact with a solid surface.\\n\\n(2) The lighting is really intriguing in some scenes. I enjoy the scenes where they emulate a single light source being the only lighting in a scene. They use the beams of a flashlight, a street light or the headlights of a car to light up the scene. I also like their emulation of natural light as it looks rather lifelike. Also, just like in Save Me 2, they use the orange and cyan color scheme to great effect.\\n\\n(4) The tracking shots they use are excellent. Long and drawn out shots like these usually cause more suspense and are therefore put to great effect in this drama while tracking a character’s movement throughout for example an abandoned building.\\n\\n(5) Although they changed the director, they have kept the same writer for all three seasons, which has preserved the writing style of the Voice series. The writing style itself is pretty unique and distinct with how the story all has one overarching case each season but has smaller cases sprinkled throughout the season. There are also plenty of cliffhangers towards the ending of certain episodes which I enjoy as it heightens the suspense.\\n\\n(6) The show runners made some better decisions this time around to not include ridiculously reality breaking events from taking place in the drama, like in earlier seasons. Some examples would be someone digging a huge grave in winter in 45 minutes. Sure, the drama has sci-fi elements but apart from the protagonists extraordinary hearing, the rest of the story is supposed to be based in reality. Good on the writer for not repeating the mistakes made earlier.   \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) Since they didn’t change the writer from earlier seasons, the at times clumsy writing and writing issues makes the series require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be watchable. A lot of thought went into the ”how” a scene should be constructed, and the ”why” was at best an afterthought. The writer has a very distinctive style of writing which does have its charms but does get stale after three seasons. Many tricks that the writer has in her tool box have already been used by season 3, making them less impactful when employed again. The team being disbanded? It’s like the fifth time that we’ve seen that threat. A suspect getting up after being knocked unconscious and causing more havoc because the police officers didn’t bother to cuff him? Yup, not new. The real criminal not being who they initial thought? A Voice series classic. Different minor cases just happen to be related to the main case because it’s convenient for the plot? You bet.\\n\\n(2) The writing is also frustrating because of how incompetent the police force comes across.  I know that the police in South Korea doesn’t have that much power as much of their power was stripped from them after misusing it during the 70’s and 80’s, but the incompetence of the police force on the whole as portrayed in this drama is astonishing. Apparently, nothing is ever locked in a police station and a civilian can waltz in there however they like. Moreover, these police officers weighing around 80 kilos that have no problem handling specially trained assassins in one scene, suddenly struggle to control and being out maneuvered by small men and women weighing around 50-60 kilos in close quarters combat. Furthermore, it has been a recurring problem of the series that a lot of suspects have priors and the police has a bunch of intel on them yet they never run checks on them until they are already on the run and these people can just operate their businesses freely despite their criminal records. \\n\\n(3) Starting off the series with a 8 month time skip from the end of season 2 was not very well executed. It makes the character relations feel very disjointed to how they used to act back in season 2. A lot has apparently changed in that time but it isn’t established right off the bat what has happened to make the characters different from how we know them. This makes the characterization feel off. The establishment of exposition isn’t as lazy as in the second season, but it’s halfway there. \\n\\n(4) I wish the acting was better than it is. Not only do some side characters have pretty dodgy acting but it also applies to the main characters. The main actress Lee Hana who has been in all three iterations of Voice as call center leader Kang Kwon Joo should do a better job than she does in my opinion. She has had plenty of time to get familiar with the character and figure out how to properly express said character. Her acting is by now means terrible but considering she has 13 years of acting experience, I had higher hopes for her performance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,0 / 10* \\\\- The writing has never been the strong suit of the Voice series and continues to be mediocre in this iteration. The acting in Voice 3 is also weaker than in previous installations. However, this time around the direction is really high quality which saves the drama in my mind.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Arthdal Chronicles (Season 1) - TvN**\\n\\nHistorical fantasy drama about the mythical first kingdom known as Arthdal.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good*\\n\\n(1) This drama is very ambitious and potentially groundbreaking. I haven’t seen anything like it from a Korean drama ever. The setting of being a historical drama but not taking place during Joseon or Goryeo but rather in a mythical early civilization setting is very unique. This is also the most traditionally fantasy ala Lord of the Rings that a kdrama has ever gotten. The production is a huge gamble in that it’s setting its feet on uncharted territory for Korean productions, which I appreciate.\\n\\n(2) The cast is really star studded and they mostly do a great job with the acting throughout the series. Song Joong Ki, Kim Ji Won, Jang Dong Gun, and Kim Ok Bin are all decorated and very experienced and talented, which really shows. This drama is no easy task and finding much better actors to tackle it would have been hard. In many scenes, I was struck by how the main actors just commanded presences and jumped out of the screen.   \\n\\n(3) The set design I find to be very pleasing. Especially the large amount of outdoor sets that are really complex. The outdoor sets also mean that they can be more liberal with their practical effects. I jump out of joy when I see real fire, as it looks so dope compared to digital fire. The real fire also helps create spectacular lighting. I enjoy seeing the flicker of flames on the faces off the actors in tense scenes.\\n\\n(4) The metaphor of the dujeumsaengs and Neanderthals of being treated like many native people by a majority group or settlers is quite smart. Much like the natives, they think that land shouldn’t or can’t be owned but rather it is something given to man by the gods for everyone to share. Enter the Saram, who proceed to ravage their villages, take away their land and freedom, all for the sake of their own profit. The sentiment isn’t exactly new, as the whole exploitation of nature theme has been explored in other works of fiction like “Pocahontas” and even in other works of fantasy like Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” and Cameron’s “Avatar”, but I enjoy it still.\\n\\n(5) The drama being pre produced along with having really talented people spearheading it helps a lot with the quality of writing and production. The director for the show is hitmaker Kim Won Suk who has many quality shows under his belt such as \"Misaeng\", \"Signal\" and \"My Mister\". On the writing side, we find the team of writer Kim Young Hyun and writer Park Sang Yeon who wrote plenty of great historical dramas like \"Queen Seon Duk\", \"Tree With Deep Roots\" and \"Six Flying Dragons\" together. Both the producer’s and the writers’ track record speaks for themselves as they do just as great of a job in this show.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad*\\n\\n(1) I need a goddamn lore book or wiki for this drama. There is so much information about characters, places, clans, gods and races that are thrown at you at once. I feel like I almost need to read up on all of it or rewatch the episodes multiple times. I understand that the first season needs to be exposition heavy, but sometimes it just becomes a bit to overbearing.\\n\\n(2) Some characters interpretations are a bit too modern for my liking. For instance, Kim Ok Bin’s character Tae Al Ha feels too out of place. Her mannerisms and the way she talks just sounds so modern considering the historical setting. Now, one could argue that this is fantasy so there is no frame of reference for how people of the time actually spoke. However, considering that the rest of the cast that plays the roles of nobles speak with the typical “saeguk-cadence”, Tae Al Ha feels a bit out of place. Whether Tae Al Ha is acted this way because of Kim Ok Bin or the director or someone else on set, we may never know. \\n\\n(3) There is a LOT of CGI in this drama and it doesn’t always look that good. Some of the time it looks solid, when the lighting and shadows and textures and movement looks as it should look. Most of the time, the effects could have needed some more work. Mainly, some of the backgrounds that are entirely or partly computer generated look a little flat, (see Sea of Tears for instance). Also, the interactions between real actors and environments and CG objects and animals look a little jarring sometimes. The CGI usually looks fine at a distance, but when they show CGI animals or backgrounds up close to the camera or decided to go full CGI camera and 100% digital shot, like the opening shot at The Great Black Cliff, it takes you out of the immersion of the show.\\n\\n(4) Despite the large budget some of the budget restraints are showing. The costumes, makeup and locations, have been criticized and I can see why. While they look fine enough when just casually watching the show, the flaws start to show once you analyze the series shot by shot. Like I said at the beginning, this show is a huge gamble and in some aspects it shows that the show is a first step toward creating full scale fantasy shows for the Korean market like this one.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 8,5 / 10* \\\\- Despite some of its shortcomings, Arthdal Chronicles still is a really good show and only promises to get even more intense in season 2 &amp; 3.',\n",

This is the last part of the review series. I planned to put this out way earlier but due to family events and sickness, the last part took me a long time to write. For this part, the rules of which dramas were eligible for review might seem arbitrary, but they are necessary. Since I decided upon only sticking to the first half, any series that was not finished before the halfway point of 2019 (July 1), I won’t be reviewing in this series. Perhaps I will talk about them some other time but for now let’s stick to the five dramas in the title of the post. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As usual, let&amp;#39;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May and June&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Secret Life of My Secretary - SBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A romcom drama about a director at a telecom company who develops face-blindness and the only one whom he recognizes is his secretary.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The show is campy in the best way possible. To truly understand why this drama works, we need to talk about the element of camp. A piece of media being described as “campy” indicates that it is ridiculous and over the top in a way that is cheesy but it’s sometimes tacky taste and ironic value is what makes it enjoyable. So many things in this drama are very over the top, but that just adds to the campiness of the show. The show also dips into being a genre parody, which I find hilarious. Whether or not the campiness and parody-like moments are intentional or not is up for debate, but I consider the show to be rather self aware.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Kim Jae Kyung as Veronica Park, the CEO of a giant film company, is just such a hoot. Now some may say that the character Veronica Park is just Jun Ji Hyun’s Cheon Song Yi from You Who Came From The Stars on way too much caffeine, but I’d like to think that she is a pretty good joke/comic relief character on top of having a fair number of pretty human and relatable moments. Veronica Park is meant to be a character that is half parody and half serious. For the most part, she is hilarious and even has some elaborate jokes in the show. One such example is her showing her powers of telling when a movie is supposed to do well in the box office and then dissing Train to Busan saying it’s going to be a failure was hysterical. However, she also has her scenes where she shows off her insecurities which affect her character as well, which made me connect with her more than just as a comic relief. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The genre parody moments had me rolling.For instance, having cherry blossom petals and raining falling at the same on the main couples first date had me rolling. On top of that, we also got other cliché happenings accompanying the main couple for their such as bubbles, fireworks, more rain, falling stars, you name it. They through the romantic effects “kitchen sink” at the viewer and it ends up being really funny in a tongue-in-cheek way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Other things that are supposed to be romantic also end up being comedic, and I kind of love that. Such as Min Ik putting her hands in his armpits to warm them up. Like I get that it seems sweet but I know how sweaty your armpits get in a three piece suit. Once again, I’m not sure if this was intended to be a genre parody or not, but I choose to view it as such.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some pretty sick shots in the drama as well, believe it or not. There is a shot in the office of the male lead, Do Min Ik played by Kim Young Kwang, that was made to look like it was filmed from within the aquarium was so sick. I got surprised when suddenly a fish entered the frame and then it hit me. That shot showed some really creative thinking on the directors part. I would guess that was done by filming the fish from the outside, mirroring the picture and then putting it as the outward most layer on top of the regular angle shot. I could be wrong though. Still impressed that they decided to experiment a bit with the cinematography without it becoming overbearing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) Despite how light hearted the drama is, it actually has some heavier moments as well that hit me harder than I would have expected. The female lead, Jung Gal Hee played by Jin Ki Joo, doesn’t have an easy life and the actress really sells that as well. Her crying plays with your heart just as much as all the sweet moments between the two leads with all the “lovey dovey”-ness that is in their eyes. Probably the peak of emotional moments for me is &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;the rooftop scene where Min Ik and Gal Hee have their first kiss. She knows that kissing him under the pretense of being Veronica Park is bad and even says to herself and her dead mother after giving in to her own desires: “I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to die young since that is the only way that I’ll get to see you again, But now, I don’t think I will ever be able to see you again. I might not be able to up to where you are”.&lt;/span&gt; Personally, this hit me like a truck as I thought it was a really powerful and human statement. Through this it has become clear that Gal Hee decided she will no longer live for someone else, but instead live for herself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the drama becomes very enjoyable because of its campy nature, there are a lot of flaws that comes from being a cheese fest as well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The show requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, as the whole set up of the drama relies on the male lead being a clueless fool once he gets hit with facial blindness. This guy who was a master at picking up social clues before being hit with facial blindness, suddenly becomes inept at sensing in someone’s voice when they are crying right in front of him and also can’t recognize the female lead’s voice or mannerisms even though they spend almost every waking hour together. As a viewer, these kinds of issues are just something you’ll have to turn a blind eye on. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The stunts are certainly not within the expectations of visual media in the 21st century at all. In the second episode a character is seen falling from a building. In the first shot of the scene, the speed, angle and manner the character falls in makes it very obvious that they used wires to make sure the person stops about halfway from the ground. Also, in my humble opinion, using wires looks worse than having someone someone falling onto a mat because of the risk of looking fake. Thankfully, they at least edited out the wires with a film processing software. In the next shot, the character is seen from above falling towards the ground and the green screen effect used here to simulate that the character is indeed falling and not acting standing in front a green screen is terrible. I’ve seen youtubers make better green screen effects than this. The perspective of the scenery in the effect makes it obvious that the background is indeed 2d and not 3d.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) There are other effects that are really cheesy and low effort as well, like showing a star falling on the night sky when there is no context of why they would show that shot at all and the effect doesn’t even look good. The exposure of the shot is way off considering that they are showing a Seoul skyline filled with bright lights and somehow a falling star manages to be spotted yet even brighter than the city lights. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a pretty cliché and cheesy drama, but it is quite self aware and that makes it okay in my book. I think it’s strengths outweighs it flaws which makes it far from great but extremely enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abyss - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A fantasy crime drama about a mysterious object who can revive people, both good and bad, and a group of people who try to stop a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The Metamorphosis reference and parallels. In one scene, we see the antagonist Oh Yeong Cheol reading “The Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka in a café. This gives us some insight on his ideology. Much like the father in “The Metamorphosis” he believes that every person who is useless to him in this world is as good as an insect, and deserving of being beaten until they either serve his purposes or die.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This also gives some foreshadowing to the rest of the drama, as “The Metamorphosis” is commonly seen as an outlet for Kafka to write about &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;his own father issues and how his abusive father shaped him into what he became. The same goes for Seo Ji Wook played by Kwon Soo Hyun. His experiences with his own abusive father largely has turned him into the person he is today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The Metamorphosis” is also commonly seen as not only a story about a man transforming into a vermin, but also the story of a girl transforming into a woman as the sister of the main character of the novel, makes her own journey to womanhood. &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;This can also be said for Hee Jin played by Han So Hee who goes from being quite immature to morphing into a responsible woman.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Ahn Hyo Seop sounds really good when he is speaking in foreign languages which is very in character for Cha Min. This is rather rare in a kdrama so I found this impressive. Even if the actor is not fluent like Ahn Hyo Seop, there is no shame in dubbing an actor who can’t speak a language when you want to convey the image of a professional who is fluent in several languages. I wish more kdramas would do this instead of having them speak poor English/French/Russian/Chinese/Japanese etc. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with speaking with a heavy accent. Speaking a language with a heavy accent is perfect if it fits the character, but when it doesn’t fit the character it definitely breaks the immersion for the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Park Bo Young’s acting, man, it’s so good. If I compare it with her other two latest dramas, Oh My Ghostess and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, I think the one thing that she has gotten a lot better at is her comedic timing. She has truly evolved that part of her repertoire which results in some truly hilarious moments that otherwise would have fell flat if her delivery wasn’t so on point.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The soundtrack is nice. The OST list is not very extensive but the tracklist with songs by Suran, Coogie, Kim Feel and Kim Bohyung still remains memorable and suits the different moments of the show well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) For the most part, the drama is well shot. In particular, I really like the crane shots that they use pretty sparingly but to great effect for showing perspective in wide shots and establishing frames. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The director and writer takes a little too much influence from mediocre horror movies. It becomes apparent through the use of sudden noises and horror movie music which leads into a lot of fake outs just to get a reaction out of the audience. Another aspect of the mediocre horror movie influences is that everyone who is not a villain in this series makes stupid and irrational decisions constantly. Much like the cast of a slasher or a horror film characters don’t even try to run or survive, they willingly go to secluded areas with a person they know is a murderer and prove themselves to be too stupid to live. The purpose of a lot of characters is just to die, which is just horrible writing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) There is way too much time wasted with recycled scenes and footage. The reason you would do this is to fill the runtime while spending less money. For example, they spent 14 minutes in Episode 5 just recapping the previous episode and showing some additional scenes that didn’t contain any additional plot information. Those are 14 minutes of air time wasted. They could have just extended the previous episode by 5 minutes to fit in those extra scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) What is up with the focus in certain shots? For the most part, it’s all right, but sometimes they either shift focus too quickly which results in a blurry mess or the characters who should be emphasised in the frame are out of focus where the camera is focused on something irrelevant in either the foreground or the background. They rarely use the blurry focus for the purpose of achieving a cool shot or a certain effect. It’s just poor camera work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) For a show about a supernatural orb that can bring people back to life, there is very unimaginative writing to go along with it. Rather than using the orb as a way of writing interesting plotlines, they just go about things in the exact same way that a non-supernatural show would go about things. For example,&amp;gt;! instead of having to write in a female accomplice that shows up disguise as a cop to help Oh Yeong Cheol to escape from prison, how cool would it have been if he schemed his way out of prison by using the mechanics of the Abyss? !&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Speaking of which, they made the mechanics of the Abyss way less interesting than they could have been. Instead of having the Abyss be able to switch between users when they die like a daisy chain to the next person who was revived after they were. Instead they decided to put a limitation on it returning it to the original users if a new user dies, resulting in way less interesting possibilities for the writers to integrate the Abyss in changing the plot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) There is a clear disconnect between Ahn Se Ha and Ahn Hyo Seop as well as Kim Sa Ra and Park Bo Young. They don’t feel like they are the same character in different bodies, as their mannerisms, expressions and to an extent personalities are completely different after the transformation. Compared to another body switching drama of this year, Spring Turns to Spring, that drama executes this aspect way better than Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) Making a story about the superficiality in South Korea and the modern world as a whole is not a new concept in kdrama but it’s a topic that I still feel is pretty fresh, but the execution is not very good and they don’t touch on the topic other than at surface level. It also doesn’t help that the drama reinforces unrealistic beauty standards for both men and women as the drama indirectly tells you that if you look like Ahn Se Ha, then you are an ugly guy and if you look worse than Park Bo Young then you are a below-average looking girl. However, I realise everything has a context and that this is dramaland and if you don’t have a conventionally attractive lead, the drama is not going to do as well.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 4,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - Cool concept and good acting but the writing is abysmal to the point where it ruins the drama completely. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Me 2 - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A psychological mystery drama about people living in a village that is about to be made into a reservoir and a fake religious group looking to scam the villagers of everything they got.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Although this is a setup heavy drama, the setup is rather well executed. It is never confusing or vague, yet the foreshadowing and hints don’t become so obvious it’s patronizing.  There is a great eye for detail throughout the drama. For instance, when they were building the church and they installed a ramp to the altar stage I wondered what that is for and a couple of episodes later it becomes apparent that Elder Choi had a thought behind even such a small background detail. Good job and coordination by the writer and the set designer to make this line up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) I really like the lighting of the drama. In the daylight scenes, the colors are quite dusty and washed out. As a juxtaposition, the night time scenes uses the very commonly used color palette of orange and teal (or alternatively red and blue). Although the aforementioned color scheme is used often (especially in Hollywood), I think there is good reason for it. The main reason is because these colors are complimentary colors that create a lot of contrast between each other while at the same time highlighting the human skin in the best way possible. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The locations feel unique and authentic. With so many dramas taking place in the glitzy big city, it is refreshing to see a drama take place in the countryside and in run down small towns. It’s not a glamorous setting, but it helps us understand the simple lives that most of the cast are living.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) Best anti-hero protagonist of the year so far. Kim Min Cheol is a real menace. He is not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination and he is not supposed to be one either. Although he is not the most law abiding citizen, he still has some good to him and stands up for the ones he cares about. To add on to his already rough and intimidating persona is the voice of Uhm Tae Goo which sounds like he has been eating razor blades for breakfast every morning. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) I really enjoy the way they portray the individual and group psychology throughout the show. It gives pretty good insight into why people would join a cult, how people deal with pain and loss as well as how effective having a common enemy is for building a strong group.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) Some of the fighting scenes look really solidly choreographed and you can really feel the impact of them. I like how sluggish Min Cheol’s fighting is, as he is far removed from his days as a martial artist and deals entirely with street brawls nowadays. I actually caught myself flinching at how hard hitting the violence is at points with how painful some blows look and how crunchy the sound is from the impacts. This is how I like my violence, not clean and polished but really raw-looking without exaggerating the gore. I think this approach is less about glorifying or making light of violence but instead showing how ugly it can really be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) I know this is a preferential thing, like I’ve stated before these are just my takes not hard facts, but there is too much shaky cam being used in certain scenes to achieve a sense of urgency. It doesn’t help either that they often use zoom when executing a shaky cam sequence either. For me as a viewer, it just creates this effect of nausea. I mean it’s fine if you want to use it to indicate that a person is shaking someone, but then they should stabilize it once the person stops and not continue with the handheld shaky cam. That just comes of like they couldn’t plant a tripod in that spot and they didn’t have a chest rig on set.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The story takes so long to get going as it is a very set up heavy drama like mentioned earlier. About half the drama is just set up for the major plot events of the second half, so the first half might feel like a bit of a slog, especially if you were to binge watch the show. In my opinion, the all the set up is worth the pay off and the set up is even quite entertaining to watch. However, I can see why this kind of a threshold is off-putting to some. I suspect that this issue is a result of being an adaptation of the 2013 animated film “The Fake”. Stretching the plot from a 2 hour film to a 16 hour drama does usually come with some growing pains.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The portrayal of religious belief and religious people is not very nuanced. If that is what you are looking for, than this drama is probably not what you are after as religion is merely painted as evil. The spiritual leaders are portrayed as being all evil and selfish and the believers are portrayed as fools. Although I am not one bit sympathetic to the acts of religious cults around the world, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced picture painted by showing the positive sides of religion and contrasting the schemes of madmen with the strength that can be granted from healthy theology.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) OCN dramas needs to give their special effects department a bigger budget. This is not the first time where a drama of theirs has had really poor special effects. The biggest offense is as usual fire. It becomes so apparent when they use CGI fire instead of real fire, that I can’t focus on anything else than the fake flames in what is supposed to be a serious scene.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama is definitely a grower and it’s a drama that requires a fair bit of patience but if you are willing to put the time into it there are a lot of factors that makes Save Me 2 an enjoyable show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice 3: City of Accomplices - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Crime thriller with sci-fi elements about a call center team trying to hunt down an illegal cartel ran through the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The production value has gone way up since earlier seasons, especially since season 1. It’s more well shot than ever before. The reason for this can partially be attributed to the director changing every season and for season 3 they brought in the director of Tunnel, which bumped up the direction quality a fair bit. No longer do I have to suffer through camera shadows showing in some shots, which really breaks immersion for the viewer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The quality has also increased in the prop and editing department. They stepped up their blood game. In earlier seasons, the blood has been really poor looking overall. Whenever they decided to use digital blood, it looked absolutely atrocious and the times when there was writing in blood the fake blood prop was way off in texture and color and ended up looking like regular paint. They have now eliminated those problems in the third season. The special effects makeup has also gotten better. Now, the viewer doesn’t have to look at the edge of the silicon that they used to recreate a wound flapping about. Also, the sound effects work has gotten better. A knife being waved about in midair now sounds like it should (“swoosh swoosh”) and doesn’t make stabbing sounds (“schlink schlink”) indicating that the metal is making contact with a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The lighting is really intriguing in some scenes. I enjoy the scenes where they emulate a single light source being the only lighting in a scene. They use the beams of a flashlight, a street light or the headlights of a car to light up the scene. I also like their emulation of natural light as it looks rather lifelike. Also, just like in Save Me 2, they use the orange and cyan color scheme to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The tracking shots they use are excellent. Long and drawn out shots like these usually cause more suspense and are therefore put to great effect in this drama while tracking a character’s movement throughout for example an abandoned building.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) Although they changed the director, they have kept the same writer for all three seasons, which has preserved the writing style of the Voice series. The writing style itself is pretty unique and distinct with how the story all has one overarching case each season but has smaller cases sprinkled throughout the season. There are also plenty of cliffhangers towards the ending of certain episodes which I enjoy as it heightens the suspense.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) The show runners made some better decisions this time around to not include ridiculously reality breaking events from taking place in the drama, like in earlier seasons. Some examples would be someone digging a huge grave in winter in 45 minutes. Sure, the drama has sci-fi elements but apart from the protagonists extraordinary hearing, the rest of the story is supposed to be based in reality. Good on the writer for not repeating the mistakes made earlier.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Since they didn’t change the writer from earlier seasons, the at times clumsy writing and writing issues makes the series require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be watchable. A lot of thought went into the ”how” a scene should be constructed, and the ”why” was at best an afterthought. The writer has a very distinctive style of writing which does have its charms but does get stale after three seasons. Many tricks that the writer has in her tool box have already been used by season 3, making them less impactful when employed again. The team being disbanded? It’s like the fifth time that we’ve seen that threat. A suspect getting up after being knocked unconscious and causing more havoc because the police officers didn’t bother to cuff him? Yup, not new. The real criminal not being who they initial thought? A Voice series classic. Different minor cases just happen to be related to the main case because it’s convenient for the plot? You bet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The writing is also frustrating because of how incompetent the police force comes across.  I know that the police in South Korea doesn’t have that much power as much of their power was stripped from them after misusing it during the 70’s and 80’s, but the incompetence of the police force on the whole as portrayed in this drama is astonishing. Apparently, nothing is ever locked in a police station and a civilian can waltz in there however they like. Moreover, these police officers weighing around 80 kilos that have no problem handling specially trained assassins in one scene, suddenly struggle to control and being out maneuvered by small men and women weighing around 50-60 kilos in close quarters combat. Furthermore, it has been a recurring problem of the series that a lot of suspects have priors and the police has a bunch of intel on them yet they never run checks on them until they are already on the run and these people can just operate their businesses freely despite their criminal records. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Starting off the series with a 8 month time skip from the end of season 2 was not very well executed. It makes the character relations feel very disjointed to how they used to act back in season 2. A lot has apparently changed in that time but it isn’t established right off the bat what has happened to make the characters different from how we know them. This makes the characterization feel off. The establishment of exposition isn’t as lazy as in the second season, but it’s halfway there. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) I wish the acting was better than it is. Not only do some side characters have pretty dodgy acting but it also applies to the main characters. The main actress Lee Hana who has been in all three iterations of Voice as call center leader Kang Kwon Joo should do a better job than she does in my opinion. She has had plenty of time to get familiar with the character and figure out how to properly express said character. Her acting is by now means terrible but considering she has 13 years of acting experience, I had higher hopes for her performance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The writing has never been the strong suit of the Voice series and continues to be mediocre in this iteration. The acting in Voice 3 is also weaker than in previous installations. However, this time around the direction is really high quality which saves the drama in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthdal Chronicles (Season 1) - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Historical fantasy drama about the mythical first kingdom known as Arthdal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is very ambitious and potentially groundbreaking. I haven’t seen anything like it from a Korean drama ever. The setting of being a historical drama but not taking place during Joseon or Goryeo but rather in a mythical early civilization setting is very unique. This is also the most traditionally fantasy ala Lord of the Rings that a kdrama has ever gotten. The production is a huge gamble in that it’s setting its feet on uncharted territory for Korean productions, which I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The cast is really star studded and they mostly do a great job with the acting throughout the series. Song Joong Ki, Kim Ji Won, Jang Dong Gun, and Kim Ok Bin are all decorated and very experienced and talented, which really shows. This drama is no easy task and finding much better actors to tackle it would have been hard. In many scenes, I was struck by how the main actors just commanded presences and jumped out of the screen.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The set design I find to be very pleasing. Especially the large amount of outdoor sets that are really complex. The outdoor sets also mean that they can be more liberal with their practical effects. I jump out of joy when I see real fire, as it looks so dope compared to digital fire. The real fire also helps create spectacular lighting. I enjoy seeing the flicker of flames on the faces off the actors in tense scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The metaphor of the dujeumsaengs and Neanderthals of being treated like many native people by a majority group or settlers is quite smart. Much like the natives, they think that land shouldn’t or can’t be owned but rather it is something given to man by the gods for everyone to share. Enter the Saram, who proceed to ravage their villages, take away their land and freedom, all for the sake of their own profit. The sentiment isn’t exactly new, as the whole exploitation of nature theme has been explored in other works of fiction like “Pocahontas” and even in other works of fantasy like Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” and Cameron’s “Avatar”, but I enjoy it still.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) The drama being pre produced along with having really talented people spearheading it helps a lot with the quality of writing and production. The director for the show is hitmaker Kim Won Suk who has many quality shows under his belt such as &amp;quot;Misaeng&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My Mister&amp;quot;. On the writing side, we find the team of writer Kim Young Hyun and writer Park Sang Yeon who wrote plenty of great historical dramas like &amp;quot;Queen Seon Duk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tree With Deep Roots&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Six Flying Dragons&amp;quot; together. Both the producer’s and the writers’ track record speaks for themselves as they do just as great of a job in this show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) I need a goddamn lore book or wiki for this drama. There is so much information about characters, places, clans, gods and races that are thrown at you at once. I feel like I almost need to read up on all of it or rewatch the episodes multiple times. I understand that the first season needs to be exposition heavy, but sometimes it just becomes a bit to overbearing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Some characters interpretations are a bit too modern for my liking. For instance, Kim Ok Bin’s character Tae Al Ha feels too out of place. Her mannerisms and the way she talks just sounds so modern considering the historical setting. Now, one could argue that this is fantasy so there is no frame of reference for how people of the time actually spoke. However, considering that the rest of the cast that plays the roles of nobles speak with the typical “saeguk-cadence”, Tae Al Ha feels a bit out of place. Whether Tae Al Ha is acted this way because of Kim Ok Bin or the director or someone else on set, we may never know. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) There is a LOT of CGI in this drama and it doesn’t always look that good. Some of the time it looks solid, when the lighting and shadows and textures and movement looks as it should look. Most of the time, the effects could have needed some more work. Mainly, some of the backgrounds that are entirely or partly computer generated look a little flat, (see Sea of Tears for instance). Also, the interactions between real actors and environments and CG objects and animals look a little jarring sometimes. The CGI usually looks fine at a distance, but when they show CGI animals or backgrounds up close to the camera or decided to go full CGI camera and 100% digital shot, like the opening shot at The Great Black Cliff, it takes you out of the immersion of the show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) Despite the large budget some of the budget restraints are showing. The costumes, makeup and locations, have been criticized and I can see why. While they look fine enough when just casually watching the show, the flaws start to show once you analyze the series shot by shot. Like I said at the beginning, this show is a huge gamble and in some aspects it shows that the show is a first step toward creating full scale fantasy shows for the Korean market like this one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - Despite some of its shortcomings, Arthdal Chronicles still is a really good show and only promises to get even more intense in season 2 &amp;amp; 3.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I was on vacation and thought maybe Goblin would be the perfect show for my plane ride, so I end up downloading it and I only got to episode 3 or 4 I think because I&amp;#39;m just so damn frustrated. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer, I really love the acting, and want to finish it for the Grim Reaper and Sunny (ik they are star crossed but I absolutely love their chemistry). I love the OST and I think the shots are honestly beautiful. But I&amp;#39;m so annoyed with the repeating plot, Eun-tak pressures him and says she&amp;#39;ll marry him, and Shin runs away. I just need some progression and I wanted to know if anyone else had trouble finishing it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He wanted to gain more power and decided to work in the National Assembly. Now, he is the chief aide to a 4-time lawmaker. He has excellent intuition, a cold-blooded decisiveness and a strong desire to win. He was able to place his lawmaker in the position of the party representative, but Jang Tae-Joon has higher ambitions.

He wanted to gain more power and decided to work in the National Assembly. Now, he is the chief aide to a 4-time lawmaker. He has excellent intuition, a cold-blooded decisiveness and a strong desire to win. He was able to place his lawmaker in the position of the party representative, but Jang Tae-Joon has higher ambitions. Meanwhile Kang Sun-Young is a first year lawmaker who got elected through proportional representation and is a spokesperson for her party. She worked as a lawyer and hosted a current affairs TV program prior to becoming a lawmaker. She is ambitious and does her job well. Kang Sun-Young has an awkward relationship with Jang Tae-Joon, whose boss is a rival of the senior lawmaker who got her to become proportional representation lawmaker.

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\n**Links to the other parts of the series:**\\n\\n[**Part 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c12lyy/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/) **I**[ **Part 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c2nqne/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/) **I**[ **Part 3**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c49q4p/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/) **I** [**Part 4**](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c6qzuh/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/)\\n\\nThus, it has come to an end. This is the last part of the review series. I planned to put this out way earlier but due to family events and sickness, the last part took me a long time to write. For this part, the rules of which dramas were eligible for review might seem arbitrary, but they are necessary. Since I decided upon only sticking to the first half, any series that was not finished before the halfway point of 2019 (July 1), I won’t be reviewing in this series. Perhaps I will talk about them some other time but for now let’s stick to the five dramas in the title of the post. \\n\\nFor additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.\\n\\nAs usual, let\\'s get started!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**May and June**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The Secret Life of My Secretary - SBS**\\n\\nA romcom drama about a director at a telecom company who develops face-blindness and the only one whom he recognizes is his secretary.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:* \\n\\n(1) The show is campy in the best way possible. To truly understand why this drama works, we need to talk about the element of camp. A piece of media being described as “campy” indicates that it is ridiculous and over the top in a way that is cheesy but it’s sometimes tacky taste and ironic value is what makes it enjoyable. So many things in this drama are very over the top, but that just adds to the campiness of the show. The show also dips into being a genre parody, which I find hilarious. Whether or not the campiness and parody-like moments are intentional or not is up for debate, but I consider the show to be rather self aware.\\n\\n(2) Kim Jae Kyung as Veronica Park, the CEO of a giant film company, is just such a hoot. Now some may say that the character Veronica Park is just Jun Ji Hyun’s Cheon Song Yi from You Who Came From The Stars on way too much caffeine, but I’d like to think that she is a pretty good joke/comic relief character on top of having a fair number of pretty human and relatable moments. Veronica Park is meant to be a character that is half parody and half serious. For the most part, she is hilarious and even has some elaborate jokes in the show. One such example is her showing her powers of telling when a movie is supposed to do well in the box office and then dissing Train to Busan saying it’s going to be a failure was hysterical. However, she also has her scenes where she shows off her insecurities which affect her character as well, which made me connect with her more than just as a comic relief. \\n\\n(3) The genre parody moments had me rolling.For instance, having cherry blossom petals and raining falling at the same on the main couples first date had me rolling. On top of that, we also got other cliché happenings accompanying the main couple for their such as bubbles, fireworks, more rain, falling stars, you name it. They through the romantic effects “kitchen sink” at the viewer and it ends up being really funny in a tongue-in-cheek way.\\n\\nOther things that are supposed to be romantic also end up being comedic, and I kind of love that. Such as Min Ik putting her hands in his armpits to warm them up. Like I get that it seems sweet but I know how sweaty your armpits get in a three piece suit. Once again, I’m not sure if this was intended to be a genre parody or not, but I choose to view it as such.\\n\\n(4) There are some pretty sick shots in the drama as well, believe it or not. There is a shot in the office of the male lead, Do Min Ik played by Kim Young Kwang, that was made to look like it was filmed from within the aquarium was so sick. I got surprised when suddenly a fish entered the frame and then it hit me. That shot showed some really creative thinking on the directors part. I would guess that was done by filming the fish from the outside, mirroring the picture and then putting it as the outward most layer on top of the regular angle shot. I could be wrong though. Still impressed that they decided to experiment a bit with the cinematography without it becoming overbearing. \\n\\n(5) Despite how light hearted the drama is, it actually has some heavier moments as well that hit me harder than I would have expected. The female lead, Jung Gal Hee played by Jin Ki Joo, doesn’t have an easy life and the actress really sells that as well. Her crying plays with your heart just as much as all the sweet moments between the two leads with all the “lovey dovey”-ness that is in their eyes. Probably the peak of emotional moments for me is &gt;!the rooftop scene where Min Ik and Gal Hee have their first kiss. She knows that kissing him under the pretense of being Veronica Park is bad and even says to herself and her dead mother after giving in to her own desires: “I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to die young since that is the only way that I’ll get to see you again, But now, I don’t think I will ever be able to see you again. I might not be able to up to where you are”.!&lt; Personally, this hit me like a truck as I thought it was a really powerful and human statement. Through this it has become clear that Gal Hee decided she will no longer live for someone else, but instead live for herself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\nAs the drama becomes very enjoyable because of its campy nature, there are a lot of flaws that comes from being a cheese fest as well. \\n\\n(1) The show requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, as the whole set up of the drama relies on the male lead being a clueless fool once he gets hit with facial blindness. This guy who was a master at picking up social clues before being hit with facial blindness, suddenly becomes inept at sensing in someone’s voice when they are crying right in front of him and also can’t recognize the female lead’s voice or mannerisms even though they spend almost every waking hour together. As a viewer, these kinds of issues are just something you’ll have to turn a blind eye on. \\n\\n(2) The stunts are certainly not within the expectations of visual media in the 21st century at all. In the second episode a character is seen falling from a building. In the first shot of the scene, the speed, angle and manner the character falls in makes it very obvious that they used wires to make sure the person stops about halfway from the ground. Also, in my humble opinion, using wires looks worse than having someone someone falling onto a mat because of the risk of looking fake. Thankfully, they at least edited out the wires with a film processing software. In the next shot, the character is seen from above falling towards the ground and the green screen effect used here to simulate that the character is indeed falling and not acting standing in front a green screen is terrible. I’ve seen youtubers make better green screen effects than this. The perspective of the scenery in the effect makes it obvious that the background is indeed 2d and not 3d.\\n\\n(3) There are other effects that are really cheesy and low effort as well, like showing a star falling on the night sky when there is no context of why they would show that shot at all and the effect doesn’t even look good. The exposure of the shot is way off considering that they are showing a Seoul skyline filled with bright lights and somehow a falling star manages to be spotted yet even brighter than the city lights. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,5 / 10* \\\\- It’s a pretty cliché and cheesy drama, but it is quite self aware and that makes it okay in my book. I think it’s strengths outweighs it flaws which makes it far from great but extremely enjoyable.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---** \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Abyss - TvN**\\n\\nA fantasy crime drama about a mysterious object who can revive people, both good and bad, and a group of people who try to stop a serial killer.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) The Metamorphosis reference and parallels. In one scene, we see the antagonist Oh Yeong Cheol reading “The Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka in a café. This gives us some insight on his ideology. Much like the father in “The Metamorphosis” he believes that every person who is useless to him in this world is as good as an insect, and deserving of being beaten until they either serve his purposes or die.\\n\\nThis also gives some foreshadowing to the rest of the drama, as “The Metamorphosis” is commonly seen as an outlet for Kafka to write about &gt;!his own father issues and how his abusive father shaped him into what he became. The same goes for Seo Ji Wook played by Kwon Soo Hyun. His experiences with his own abusive father largely has turned him into the person he is today.!&lt;\\n\\n“The Metamorphosis” is also commonly seen as not only a story about a man transforming into a vermin, but also the story of a girl transforming into a woman as the sister of the main character of the novel, makes her own journey to womanhood. &gt;!This can also be said for Hee Jin played by Han So Hee who goes from being quite immature to morphing into a responsible woman.   !&lt;\\n\\n(2) Ahn Hyo Seop sounds really good when he is speaking in foreign languages which is very in character for Cha Min. This is rather rare in a kdrama so I found this impressive. Even if the actor is not fluent like Ahn Hyo Seop, there is no shame in dubbing an actor who can’t speak a language when you want to convey the image of a professional who is fluent in several languages. I wish more kdramas would do this instead of having them speak poor English/French/Russian/Chinese/Japanese etc. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with speaking with a heavy accent. Speaking a language with a heavy accent is perfect if it fits the character, but when it doesn’t fit the character it definitely breaks the immersion for the viewer.\\n\\n(3) Park Bo Young’s acting, man, it’s so good. If I compare it with her other two latest dramas, Oh My Ghostess and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, I think the one thing that she has gotten a lot better at is her comedic timing. She has truly evolved that part of her repertoire which results in some truly hilarious moments that otherwise would have fell flat if her delivery wasn’t so on point.\\n\\n(4) The soundtrack is nice. The OST list is not very extensive but the tracklist with songs by Suran, Coogie, Kim Feel and Kim Bohyung still remains memorable and suits the different moments of the show well. \\n\\n(5) For the most part, the drama is well shot. In particular, I really like the crane shots that they use pretty sparingly but to great effect for showing perspective in wide shots and establishing frames. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) The director and writer takes a little too much influence from mediocre horror movies. It becomes apparent through the use of sudden noises and horror movie music which leads into a lot of fake outs just to get a reaction out of the audience. Another aspect of the mediocre horror movie influences is that everyone who is not a villain in this series makes stupid and irrational decisions constantly. Much like the cast of a slasher or a horror film characters don’t even try to run or survive, they willingly go to secluded areas with a person they know is a murderer and prove themselves to be too stupid to live. The purpose of a lot of characters is just to die, which is just horrible writing.\\n\\n(2) There is way too much time wasted with recycled scenes and footage. The reason you would do this is to fill the runtime while spending less money. For example, they spent 14 minutes in Episode 5 just recapping the previous episode and showing some additional scenes that didn’t contain any additional plot information. Those are 14 minutes of air time wasted. They could have just extended the previous episode by 5 minutes to fit in those extra scenes.\\n\\n(3) What is up with the focus in certain shots? For the most part, it’s all right, but sometimes they either shift focus too quickly which results in a blurry mess or the characters who should be emphasised in the frame are out of focus where the camera is focused on something irrelevant in either the foreground or the background. They rarely use the blurry focus for the purpose of achieving a cool shot or a certain effect. It’s just poor camera work. \\n\\n(4) For a show about a supernatural orb that can bring people back to life, there is very unimaginative writing to go along with it. Rather than using the orb as a way of writing interesting plotlines, they just go about things in the exact same way that a non-supernatural show would go about things. For example,&gt;! instead of having to write in a female accomplice that shows up disguise as a cop to help Oh Yeong Cheol to escape from prison, how cool would it have been if he schemed his way out of prison by using the mechanics of the Abyss? !&lt;\\n\\n&gt;!Speaking of which, they made the mechanics of the Abyss way less interesting than they could have been. Instead of having the Abyss be able to switch between users when they die like a daisy chain to the next person who was revived after they were. Instead they decided to put a limitation on it returning it to the original users if a new user dies, resulting in way less interesting possibilities for the writers to integrate the Abyss in changing the plot.!&lt;\\n\\n(5) There is a clear disconnect between Ahn Se Ha and Ahn Hyo Seop as well as Kim Sa Ra and Park Bo Young. They don’t feel like they are the same character in different bodies, as their mannerisms, expressions and to an extent personalities are completely different after the transformation. Compared to another body switching drama of this year, Spring Turns to Spring, that drama executes this aspect way better than Abyss.\\n\\n(6) Making a story about the superficiality in South Korea and the modern world as a whole is not a new concept in kdrama but it’s a topic that I still feel is pretty fresh, but the execution is not very good and they don’t touch on the topic other than at surface level. It also doesn’t help that the drama reinforces unrealistic beauty standards for both men and women as the drama indirectly tells you that if you look like Ahn Se Ha, then you are an ugly guy and if you look worse than Park Bo Young then you are a below-average looking girl. However, I realise everything has a context and that this is dramaland and if you don’t have a conventionally attractive lead, the drama is not going to do as well.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 4,0 / 10* \\\\- Cool concept and good acting but the writing is abysmal to the point where it ruins the drama completely. \\n\\n \\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Save Me 2 - OCN**\\n\\nA psychological mystery drama about people living in a village that is about to be made into a reservoir and a fake religious group looking to scam the villagers of everything they got.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) Although this is a setup heavy drama, the setup is rather well executed. It is never confusing or vague, yet the foreshadowing and hints don’t become so obvious it’s patronizing.  There is a great eye for detail throughout the drama. For instance, when they were building the church and they installed a ramp to the altar stage I wondered what that is for and a couple of episodes later it becomes apparent that Elder Choi had a thought behind even such a small background detail. Good job and coordination by the writer and the set designer to make this line up. \\n\\n(2) I really like the lighting of the drama. In the daylight scenes, the colors are quite dusty and washed out. As a juxtaposition, the night time scenes uses the very commonly used color palette of orange and teal (or alternatively red and blue). Although the aforementioned color scheme is used often (especially in Hollywood), I think there is good reason for it. The main reason is because these colors are complimentary colors that create a lot of contrast between each other while at the same time highlighting the human skin in the best way possible. \\n\\n(3) The locations feel unique and authentic. With so many dramas taking place in the glitzy big city, it is refreshing to see a drama take place in the countryside and in run down small towns. It’s not a glamorous setting, but it helps us understand the simple lives that most of the cast are living.\\n\\n(4) Best anti-hero protagonist of the year so far. Kim Min Cheol is a real menace. He is not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination and he is not supposed to be one either. Although he is not the most law abiding citizen, he still has some good to him and stands up for the ones he cares about. To add on to his already rough and intimidating persona is the voice of Uhm Tae Goo which sounds like he has been eating razor blades for breakfast every morning. I love it.\\n\\n(5) I really enjoy the way they portray the individual and group psychology throughout the show. It gives pretty good insight into why people would join a cult, how people deal with pain and loss as well as how effective having a common enemy is for building a strong group.\\n\\n(6) Some of the fighting scenes look really solidly choreographed and you can really feel the impact of them. I like how sluggish Min Cheol’s fighting is, as he is far removed from his days as a martial artist and deals entirely with street brawls nowadays. I actually caught myself flinching at how hard hitting the violence is at points with how painful some blows look and how crunchy the sound is from the impacts. This is how I like my violence, not clean and polished but really raw-looking without exaggerating the gore. I think this approach is less about glorifying or making light of violence but instead showing how ugly it can really be.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) I know this is a preferential thing, like I’ve stated before these are just my takes not hard facts, but there is too much shaky cam being used in certain scenes to achieve a sense of urgency. It doesn’t help either that they often use zoom when executing a shaky cam sequence either. For me as a viewer, it just creates this effect of nausea. I mean it’s fine if you want to use it to indicate that a person is shaking someone, but then they should stabilize it once the person stops and not continue with the handheld shaky cam. That just comes of like they couldn’t plant a tripod in that spot and they didn’t have a chest rig on set.\\n\\n(2) The story takes so long to get going as it is a very set up heavy drama like mentioned earlier. About half the drama is just set up for the major plot events of the second half, so the first half might feel like a bit of a slog, especially if you were to binge watch the show. In my opinion, the all the set up is worth the pay off and the set up is even quite entertaining to watch. However, I can see why this kind of a threshold is off-putting to some. I suspect that this issue is a result of being an adaptation of the 2013 animated film “The Fake”. Stretching the plot from a 2 hour film to a 16 hour drama does usually come with some growing pains.\\n\\n(3) The portrayal of religious belief and religious people is not very nuanced. If that is what you are looking for, than this drama is probably not what you are after as religion is merely painted as evil. The spiritual leaders are portrayed as being all evil and selfish and the believers are portrayed as fools. Although I am not one bit sympathetic to the acts of religious cults around the world, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced picture painted by showing the positive sides of religion and contrasting the schemes of madmen with the strength that can be granted from healthy theology.\\n\\n(4) OCN dramas needs to give their special effects department a bigger budget. This is not the first time where a drama of theirs has had really poor special effects. The biggest offense is as usual fire. It becomes so apparent when they use CGI fire instead of real fire, that I can’t focus on anything else than the fake flames in what is supposed to be a serious scene.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,5 / 10* \\\\- This drama is definitely a grower and it’s a drama that requires a fair bit of patience but if you are willing to put the time into it there are a lot of factors that makes Save Me 2 an enjoyable show.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Voice 3: City of Accomplices - OCN**\\n\\nCrime thriller with sci-fi elements about a call center team trying to hunt down an illegal cartel ran through the dark web.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good:*\\n\\n(1) The production value has gone way up since earlier seasons, especially since season 1. It’s more well shot than ever before. The reason for this can partially be attributed to the director changing every season and for season 3 they brought in the director of Tunnel, which bumped up the direction quality a fair bit. No longer do I have to suffer through camera shadows showing in some shots, which really breaks immersion for the viewer. \\n\\nThe quality has also increased in the prop and editing department. They stepped up their blood game. In earlier seasons, the blood has been really poor looking overall. Whenever they decided to use digital blood, it looked absolutely atrocious and the times when there was writing in blood the fake blood prop was way off in texture and color and ended up looking like regular paint. They have now eliminated those problems in the third season. The special effects makeup has also gotten better. Now, the viewer doesn’t have to look at the edge of the silicon that they used to recreate a wound flapping about. Also, the sound effects work has gotten better. A knife being waved about in midair now sounds like it should (“swoosh swoosh”) and doesn’t make stabbing sounds (“schlink schlink”) indicating that the metal is making contact with a solid surface.\\n\\n(2) The lighting is really intriguing in some scenes. I enjoy the scenes where they emulate a single light source being the only lighting in a scene. They use the beams of a flashlight, a street light or the headlights of a car to light up the scene. I also like their emulation of natural light as it looks rather lifelike. Also, just like in Save Me 2, they use the orange and cyan color scheme to great effect.\\n\\n(4) The tracking shots they use are excellent. Long and drawn out shots like these usually cause more suspense and are therefore put to great effect in this drama while tracking a character’s movement throughout for example an abandoned building.\\n\\n(5) Although they changed the director, they have kept the same writer for all three seasons, which has preserved the writing style of the Voice series. The writing style itself is pretty unique and distinct with how the story all has one overarching case each season but has smaller cases sprinkled throughout the season. There are also plenty of cliffhangers towards the ending of certain episodes which I enjoy as it heightens the suspense.\\n\\n(6) The show runners made some better decisions this time around to not include ridiculously reality breaking events from taking place in the drama, like in earlier seasons. Some examples would be someone digging a huge grave in winter in 45 minutes. Sure, the drama has sci-fi elements but apart from the protagonists extraordinary hearing, the rest of the story is supposed to be based in reality. Good on the writer for not repeating the mistakes made earlier.   \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad:*\\n\\n(1) Since they didn’t change the writer from earlier seasons, the at times clumsy writing and writing issues makes the series require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be watchable. A lot of thought went into the ”how” a scene should be constructed, and the ”why” was at best an afterthought. The writer has a very distinctive style of writing which does have its charms but does get stale after three seasons. Many tricks that the writer has in her tool box have already been used by season 3, making them less impactful when employed again. The team being disbanded? It’s like the fifth time that we’ve seen that threat. A suspect getting up after being knocked unconscious and causing more havoc because the police officers didn’t bother to cuff him? Yup, not new. The real criminal not being who they initial thought? A Voice series classic. Different minor cases just happen to be related to the main case because it’s convenient for the plot? You bet.\\n\\n(2) The writing is also frustrating because of how incompetent the police force comes across.  I know that the police in South Korea doesn’t have that much power as much of their power was stripped from them after misusing it during the 70’s and 80’s, but the incompetence of the police force on the whole as portrayed in this drama is astonishing. Apparently, nothing is ever locked in a police station and a civilian can waltz in there however they like. Moreover, these police officers weighing around 80 kilos that have no problem handling specially trained assassins in one scene, suddenly struggle to control and being out maneuvered by small men and women weighing around 50-60 kilos in close quarters combat. Furthermore, it has been a recurring problem of the series that a lot of suspects have priors and the police has a bunch of intel on them yet they never run checks on them until they are already on the run and these people can just operate their businesses freely despite their criminal records. \\n\\n(3) Starting off the series with a 8 month time skip from the end of season 2 was not very well executed. It makes the character relations feel very disjointed to how they used to act back in season 2. A lot has apparently changed in that time but it isn’t established right off the bat what has happened to make the characters different from how we know them. This makes the characterization feel off. The establishment of exposition isn’t as lazy as in the second season, but it’s halfway there. \\n\\n(4) I wish the acting was better than it is. Not only do some side characters have pretty dodgy acting but it also applies to the main characters. The main actress Lee Hana who has been in all three iterations of Voice as call center leader Kang Kwon Joo should do a better job than she does in my opinion. She has had plenty of time to get familiar with the character and figure out how to properly express said character. Her acting is by now means terrible but considering she has 13 years of acting experience, I had higher hopes for her performance.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 7,0 / 10* \\\\- The writing has never been the strong suit of the Voice series and continues to be mediocre in this iteration. The acting in Voice 3 is also weaker than in previous installations. However, this time around the direction is really high quality which saves the drama in my mind.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**---**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Arthdal Chronicles (Season 1) - TvN**\\n\\nHistorical fantasy drama about the mythical first kingdom known as Arthdal.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Good*\\n\\n(1) This drama is very ambitious and potentially groundbreaking. I haven’t seen anything like it from a Korean drama ever. The setting of being a historical drama but not taking place during Joseon or Goryeo but rather in a mythical early civilization setting is very unique. This is also the most traditionally fantasy ala Lord of the Rings that a kdrama has ever gotten. The production is a huge gamble in that it’s setting its feet on uncharted territory for Korean productions, which I appreciate.\\n\\n(2) The cast is really star studded and they mostly do a great job with the acting throughout the series. Song Joong Ki, Kim Ji Won, Jang Dong Gun, and Kim Ok Bin are all decorated and very experienced and talented, which really shows. This drama is no easy task and finding much better actors to tackle it would have been hard. In many scenes, I was struck by how the main actors just commanded presences and jumped out of the screen.   \\n\\n(3) The set design I find to be very pleasing. Especially the large amount of outdoor sets that are really complex. The outdoor sets also mean that they can be more liberal with their practical effects. I jump out of joy when I see real fire, as it looks so dope compared to digital fire. The real fire also helps create spectacular lighting. I enjoy seeing the flicker of flames on the faces off the actors in tense scenes.\\n\\n(4) The metaphor of the dujeumsaengs and Neanderthals of being treated like many native people by a majority group or settlers is quite smart. Much like the natives, they think that land shouldn’t or can’t be owned but rather it is something given to man by the gods for everyone to share. Enter the Saram, who proceed to ravage their villages, take away their land and freedom, all for the sake of their own profit. The sentiment isn’t exactly new, as the whole exploitation of nature theme has been explored in other works of fiction like “Pocahontas” and even in other works of fantasy like Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” and Cameron’s “Avatar”, but I enjoy it still.\\n\\n(5) The drama being pre produced along with having really talented people spearheading it helps a lot with the quality of writing and production. The director for the show is hitmaker Kim Won Suk who has many quality shows under his belt such as \"Misaeng\", \"Signal\" and \"My Mister\". On the writing side, we find the team of writer Kim Young Hyun and writer Park Sang Yeon who wrote plenty of great historical dramas like \"Queen Seon Duk\", \"Tree With Deep Roots\" and \"Six Flying Dragons\" together. Both the producer’s and the writers’ track record speaks for themselves as they do just as great of a job in this show.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*The Bad*\\n\\n(1) I need a goddamn lore book or wiki for this drama. There is so much information about characters, places, clans, gods and races that are thrown at you at once. I feel like I almost need to read up on all of it or rewatch the episodes multiple times. I understand that the first season needs to be exposition heavy, but sometimes it just becomes a bit to overbearing.\\n\\n(2) Some characters interpretations are a bit too modern for my liking. For instance, Kim Ok Bin’s character Tae Al Ha feels too out of place. Her mannerisms and the way she talks just sounds so modern considering the historical setting. Now, one could argue that this is fantasy so there is no frame of reference for how people of the time actually spoke. However, considering that the rest of the cast that plays the roles of nobles speak with the typical “saeguk-cadence”, Tae Al Ha feels a bit out of place. Whether Tae Al Ha is acted this way because of Kim Ok Bin or the director or someone else on set, we may never know. \\n\\n(3) There is a LOT of CGI in this drama and it doesn’t always look that good. Some of the time it looks solid, when the lighting and shadows and textures and movement looks as it should look. Most of the time, the effects could have needed some more work. Mainly, some of the backgrounds that are entirely or partly computer generated look a little flat, (see Sea of Tears for instance). Also, the interactions between real actors and environments and CG objects and animals look a little jarring sometimes. The CGI usually looks fine at a distance, but when they show CGI animals or backgrounds up close to the camera or decided to go full CGI camera and 100% digital shot, like the opening shot at The Great Black Cliff, it takes you out of the immersion of the show.\\n\\n(4) Despite the large budget some of the budget restraints are showing. The costumes, makeup and locations, have been criticized and I can see why. While they look fine enough when just casually watching the show, the flaws start to show once you analyze the series shot by shot. Like I said at the beginning, this show is a huge gamble and in some aspects it shows that the show is a first step toward creating full scale fantasy shows for the Korean market like this one.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Score: 8,5 / 10* \\\\- Despite some of its shortcomings, Arthdal Chronicles still is a really good show and only promises to get even more intense in season 2 &amp; 3.',\n",

This is the last part of the review series. I planned to put this out way earlier but due to family events and sickness, the last part took me a long time to write. For this part, the rules of which dramas were eligible for review might seem arbitrary, but they are necessary. Since I decided upon only sticking to the first half, any series that was not finished before the halfway point of 2019 (July 1), I won’t be reviewing in this series.

To truly understand why this drama works, we need to talk about the element of camp. A piece of media being described as “campy” indicates that it is ridiculous and over the top in a way that is cheesy but it’s sometimes tacky taste and ironic value is what makes it enjoyable. So many things in this drama are very over the top, but that just adds to the campiness of the show. The show also dips into being a genre parody, which I find hilarious. Whether or not the campiness and parody-like moments are intentional or not is up for debate, but I consider the show to be rather self aware.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Kim Jae Kyung as Veronica Park, the CEO of a giant film company, is just such a hoot. Now some may say that the character Veronica Park is just Jun Ji Hyun’s Cheon Song Yi from You Who Came From The Stars on way too much caffeine, but I’d like to think that she is a pretty good joke/comic relief character on top of having a fair number of pretty human and relatable moments. Veronica Park is meant to be a character that is half parody and half serious. For the most part, she is hilarious and even has some elaborate jokes in the show. One such example is her showing her powers of telling when a movie is supposed to do well in the box office and then dissing Train to Busan saying it’s going to be a failure was hysterical. However, she also has her scenes where she shows off her insecurities which affect her character as well, which made me connect with her more than just as a comic relief. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The genre parody moments had me rolling.For instance, having cherry blossom petals and raining falling at the same on the main couples first date had me rolling. On top of that, we also got other cliché happenings accompanying the main couple for their such as bubbles, fireworks, more rain, falling stars, you name it. They through the romantic effects “kitchen sink” at the viewer and it ends up being really funny in a tongue-in-cheek way.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Other things that are supposed to be romantic also end up being comedic, and I kind of love that. Such as Min Ik putting her hands in his armpits to warm them up. Like I get that it seems sweet but I know how sweaty your armpits get in a three piece suit. Once again, I’m not sure if this was intended to be a genre parody or not, but I choose to view it as such.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some pretty sick shots in the drama as well, believe it or not. There is a shot in the office of the male lead, Do Min Ik played by Kim Young Kwang, that was made to look like it was filmed from within the aquarium was so sick. I got surprised when suddenly a fish entered the frame and then it hit me. That shot showed some really creative thinking on the directors part. I would guess that was done by filming the fish from the outside, mirroring the picture and then putting it as the outward most layer on top of the regular angle shot. I could be wrong though. Still impressed that they decided to experiment a bit with the cinematography without it becoming overbearing. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) Despite how light hearted the drama is, it actually has some heavier moments as well that hit me harder than I would have expected. The female lead, Jung Gal Hee played by Jin Ki Joo, doesn’t have an easy life and the actress really sells that as well. Her crying plays with your heart just as much as all the sweet moments between the two leads with all the “lovey dovey”-ness that is in their eyes. Probably the peak of emotional moments for me is &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;the rooftop scene where Min Ik and Gal Hee have their first kiss. She knows that kissing him under the pretense of being Veronica Park is bad and even says to herself and her dead mother after giving in to her own desires: “I thought it wouldn’t be so bad to die young since that is the only way that I’ll get to see you again, But now, I don’t think I will ever be able to see you again. I might not be able to up to where you are”.&lt;/span&gt; Personally, this hit me like a truck as I thought it was a really powerful and human statement. Through this it has become clear that Gal Hee decided she will no longer live for someone else, but instead live for herself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the drama becomes very enjoyable because of its campy nature, there are a lot of flaws that comes from being a cheese fest as well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The show requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, as the whole set up of the drama relies on the male lead being a clueless fool once he gets hit with facial blindness. This guy who was a master at picking up social clues before being hit with facial blindness, suddenly becomes inept at sensing in someone’s voice when they are crying right in front of him and also can’t recognize the female lead’s voice or mannerisms even though they spend almost every waking hour together. As a viewer, these kinds of issues are just something you’ll have to turn a blind eye on. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The stunts are certainly not within the expectations of visual media in the 21st century at all. In the second episode a character is seen falling from a building. In the first shot of the scene, the speed, angle and manner the character falls in makes it very obvious that they used wires to make sure the person stops about halfway from the ground. Also, in my humble opinion, using wires looks worse than having someone someone falling onto a mat because of the risk of looking fake. Thankfully, they at least edited out the wires with a film processing software. In the next shot, the character is seen from above falling towards the ground and the green screen effect used here to simulate that the character is indeed falling and not acting standing in front a green screen is terrible. I’ve seen youtubers make better green screen effects than this. The perspective of the scenery in the effect makes it obvious that the background is indeed 2d and not 3d.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) There are other effects that are really cheesy and low effort as well, like showing a star falling on the night sky when there is no context of why they would show that shot at all and the effect doesn’t even look good. The exposure of the shot is way off considering that they are showing a Seoul skyline filled with bright lights and somehow a falling star manages to be spotted yet even brighter than the city lights. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a pretty cliché and cheesy drama, but it is quite self aware and that makes it okay in my book. I think it’s strengths outweighs it flaws which makes it far from great but extremely enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abyss - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A fantasy crime drama about a mysterious object who can revive people, both good and bad, and a group of people who try to stop a serial killer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The Metamorphosis reference and parallels. In one scene, we see the antagonist Oh Yeong Cheol reading “The Metamorphosis” by Franz Kafka in a café. This gives us some insight on his ideology. Much like the father in “The Metamorphosis” he believes that every person who is useless to him in this world is as good as an insect, and deserving of being beaten until they either serve his purposes or die.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This also gives some foreshadowing to the rest of the drama, as “The Metamorphosis” is commonly seen as an outlet for Kafka to write about &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;his own father issues and how his abusive father shaped him into what he became. The same goes for Seo Ji Wook played by Kwon Soo Hyun. His experiences with his own abusive father largely has turned him into the person he is today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The Metamorphosis” is also commonly seen as not only a story about a man transforming into a vermin, but also the story of a girl transforming into a woman as the sister of the main character of the novel, makes her own journey to womanhood. &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;This can also be said for Hee Jin played by Han So Hee who goes from being quite immature to morphing into a responsible woman.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Ahn Hyo Seop sounds really good when he is speaking in foreign languages which is very in character for Cha Min. This is rather rare in a kdrama so I found this impressive. Even if the actor is not fluent like Ahn Hyo Seop, there is no shame in dubbing an actor who can’t speak a language when you want to convey the image of a professional who is fluent in several languages. I wish more kdramas would do this instead of having them speak poor English/French/Russian/Chinese/Japanese etc. Don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with speaking with a heavy accent. Speaking a language with a heavy accent is perfect if it fits the character, but when it doesn’t fit the character it definitely breaks the immersion for the viewer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Park Bo Young’s acting, man, it’s so good. If I compare it with her other two latest dramas, Oh My Ghostess and Strong Woman Do Bong Soon, I think the one thing that she has gotten a lot better at is her comedic timing. She has truly evolved that part of her repertoire which results in some truly hilarious moments that otherwise would have fell flat if her delivery wasn’t so on point.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The soundtrack is nice. The OST list is not very extensive but the tracklist with songs by Suran, Coogie, Kim Feel and Kim Bohyung still remains memorable and suits the different moments of the show well. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) For the most part, the drama is well shot. In particular, I really like the crane shots that they use pretty sparingly but to great effect for showing perspective in wide shots and establishing frames. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The director and writer takes a little too much influence from mediocre horror movies. It becomes apparent through the use of sudden noises and horror movie music which leads into a lot of fake outs just to get a reaction out of the audience. Another aspect of the mediocre horror movie influences is that everyone who is not a villain in this series makes stupid and irrational decisions constantly. Much like the cast of a slasher or a horror film characters don’t even try to run or survive, they willingly go to secluded areas with a person they know is a murderer and prove themselves to be too stupid to live. The purpose of a lot of characters is just to die, which is just horrible writing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) There is way too much time wasted with recycled scenes and footage. The reason you would do this is to fill the runtime while spending less money. For example, they spent 14 minutes in Episode 5 just recapping the previous episode and showing some additional scenes that didn’t contain any additional plot information. Those are 14 minutes of air time wasted. They could have just extended the previous episode by 5 minutes to fit in those extra scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) What is up with the focus in certain shots? For the most part, it’s all right, but sometimes they either shift focus too quickly which results in a blurry mess or the characters who should be emphasised in the frame are out of focus where the camera is focused on something irrelevant in either the foreground or the background. They rarely use the blurry focus for the purpose of achieving a cool shot or a certain effect. It’s just poor camera work. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) For a show about a supernatural orb that can bring people back to life, there is very unimaginative writing to go along with it. Rather than using the orb as a way of writing interesting plotlines, they just go about things in the exact same way that a non-supernatural show would go about things. For example,&amp;gt;! instead of having to write in a female accomplice that shows up disguise as a cop to help Oh Yeong Cheol to escape from prison, how cool would it have been if he schemed his way out of prison by using the mechanics of the Abyss? !&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;Speaking of which, they made the mechanics of the Abyss way less interesting than they could have been. Instead of having the Abyss be able to switch between users when they die like a daisy chain to the next person who was revived after they were. Instead they decided to put a limitation on it returning it to the original users if a new user dies, resulting in way less interesting possibilities for the writers to integrate the Abyss in changing the plot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) There is a clear disconnect between Ahn Se Ha and Ahn Hyo Seop as well as Kim Sa Ra and Park Bo Young. They don’t feel like they are the same character in different bodies, as their mannerisms, expressions and to an extent personalities are completely different after the transformation. Compared to another body switching drama of this year, Spring Turns to Spring, that drama executes this aspect way better than Abyss.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) Making a story about the superficiality in South Korea and the modern world as a whole is not a new concept in kdrama but it’s a topic that I still feel is pretty fresh, but the execution is not very good and they don’t touch on the topic other than at surface level. It also doesn’t help that the drama reinforces unrealistic beauty standards for both men and women as the drama indirectly tells you that if you look like Ahn Se Ha, then you are an ugly guy and if you look worse than Park Bo Young then you are a below-average looking girl. However, I realise everything has a context and that this is dramaland and if you don’t have a conventionally attractive lead, the drama is not going to do as well.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 4,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - Cool concept and good acting but the writing is abysmal to the point where it ruins the drama completely. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Me 2 - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A psychological mystery drama about people living in a village that is about to be made into a reservoir and a fake religious group looking to scam the villagers of everything they got.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Although this is a setup heavy drama, the setup is rather well executed. It is never confusing or vague, yet the foreshadowing and hints don’t become so obvious it’s patronizing.  There is a great eye for detail throughout the drama. For instance, when they were building the church and they installed a ramp to the altar stage I wondered what that is for and a couple of episodes later it becomes apparent that Elder Choi had a thought behind even such a small background detail. Good job and coordination by the writer and the set designer to make this line up. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) I really like the lighting of the drama. In the daylight scenes, the colors are quite dusty and washed out. As a juxtaposition, the night time scenes uses the very commonly used color palette of orange and teal (or alternatively red and blue). Although the aforementioned color scheme is used often (especially in Hollywood), I think there is good reason for it. The main reason is because these colors are complimentary colors that create a lot of contrast between each other while at the same time highlighting the human skin in the best way possible. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The locations feel unique and authentic. With so many dramas taking place in the glitzy big city, it is refreshing to see a drama take place in the countryside and in run down small towns. It’s not a glamorous setting, but it helps us understand the simple lives that most of the cast are living.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) Best anti-hero protagonist of the year so far. Kim Min Cheol is a real menace. He is not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination and he is not supposed to be one either. Although he is not the most law abiding citizen, he still has some good to him and stands up for the ones he cares about. To add on to his already rough and intimidating persona is the voice of Uhm Tae Goo which sounds like he has been eating razor blades for breakfast every morning. I love it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) I really enjoy the way they portray the individual and group psychology throughout the show. It gives pretty good insight into why people would join a cult, how people deal with pain and loss as well as how effective having a common enemy is for building a strong group.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) Some of the fighting scenes look really solidly choreographed and you can really feel the impact of them. I like how sluggish Min Cheol’s fighting is, as he is far removed from his days as a martial artist and deals entirely with street brawls nowadays. I actually caught myself flinching at how hard hitting the violence is at points with how painful some blows look and how crunchy the sound is from the impacts. This is how I like my violence, not clean and polished but really raw-looking without exaggerating the gore. I think this approach is less about glorifying or making light of violence but instead showing how ugly it can really be.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) I know this is a preferential thing, like I’ve stated before these are just my takes not hard facts, but there is too much shaky cam being used in certain scenes to achieve a sense of urgency. It doesn’t help either that they often use zoom when executing a shaky cam sequence either. For me as a viewer, it just creates this effect of nausea. I mean it’s fine if you want to use it to indicate that a person is shaking someone, but then they should stabilize it once the person stops and not continue with the handheld shaky cam. That just comes of like they couldn’t plant a tripod in that spot and they didn’t have a chest rig on set.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The story takes so long to get going as it is a very set up heavy drama like mentioned earlier. About half the drama is just set up for the major plot events of the second half, so the first half might feel like a bit of a slog, especially if you were to binge watch the show. In my opinion, the all the set up is worth the pay off and the set up is even quite entertaining to watch. However, I can see why this kind of a threshold is off-putting to some. I suspect that this issue is a result of being an adaptation of the 2013 animated film “The Fake”. Stretching the plot from a 2 hour film to a 16 hour drama does usually come with some growing pains.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The portrayal of religious belief and religious people is not very nuanced. If that is what you are looking for, than this drama is probably not what you are after as religion is merely painted as evil. The spiritual leaders are portrayed as being all evil and selfish and the believers are portrayed as fools. Although I am not one bit sympathetic to the acts of religious cults around the world, it would have been nice to see a more nuanced picture painted by showing the positive sides of religion and contrasting the schemes of madmen with the strength that can be granted from healthy theology.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) OCN dramas needs to give their special effects department a bigger budget. This is not the first time where a drama of theirs has had really poor special effects. The biggest offense is as usual fire. It becomes so apparent when they use CGI fire instead of real fire, that I can’t focus on anything else than the fake flames in what is supposed to be a serious scene.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama is definitely a grower and it’s a drama that requires a fair bit of patience but if you are willing to put the time into it there are a lot of factors that makes Save Me 2 an enjoyable show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice 3: City of Accomplices - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Crime thriller with sci-fi elements about a call center team trying to hunt down an illegal cartel ran through the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) The production value has gone way up since earlier seasons, especially since season 1. It’s more well shot than ever before. The reason for this can partially be attributed to the director changing every season and for season 3 they brought in the director of Tunnel, which bumped up the direction quality a fair bit. No longer do I have to suffer through camera shadows showing in some shots, which really breaks immersion for the viewer. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The quality has also increased in the prop and editing department. They stepped up their blood game. In earlier seasons, the blood has been really poor looking overall. Whenever they decided to use digital blood, it looked absolutely atrocious and the times when there was writing in blood the fake blood prop was way off in texture and color and ended up looking like regular paint. They have now eliminated those problems in the third season. The special effects makeup has also gotten better. Now, the viewer doesn’t have to look at the edge of the silicon that they used to recreate a wound flapping about. Also, the sound effects work has gotten better. A knife being waved about in midair now sounds like it should (“swoosh swoosh”) and doesn’t make stabbing sounds (“schlink schlink”) indicating that the metal is making contact with a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The lighting is really intriguing in some scenes. I enjoy the scenes where they emulate a single light source being the only lighting in a scene. They use the beams of a flashlight, a street light or the headlights of a car to light up the scene. I also like their emulation of natural light as it looks rather lifelike. Also, just like in Save Me 2, they use the orange and cyan color scheme to great effect.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The tracking shots they use are excellent. Long and drawn out shots like these usually cause more suspense and are therefore put to great effect in this drama while tracking a character’s movement throughout for example an abandoned building.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) Although they changed the director, they have kept the same writer for all three seasons, which has preserved the writing style of the Voice series. The writing style itself is pretty unique and distinct with how the story all has one overarching case each season but has smaller cases sprinkled throughout the season. There are also plenty of cliffhangers towards the ending of certain episodes which I enjoy as it heightens the suspense.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(6) The show runners made some better decisions this time around to not include ridiculously reality breaking events from taking place in the drama, like in earlier seasons. Some examples would be someone digging a huge grave in winter in 45 minutes. Sure, the drama has sci-fi elements but apart from the protagonists extraordinary hearing, the rest of the story is supposed to be based in reality. Good on the writer for not repeating the mistakes made earlier.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) Since they didn’t change the writer from earlier seasons, the at times clumsy writing and writing issues makes the series require a lot of suspension of disbelief to be watchable. A lot of thought went into the ”how” a scene should be constructed, and the ”why” was at best an afterthought. The writer has a very distinctive style of writing which does have its charms but does get stale after three seasons. Many tricks that the writer has in her tool box have already been used by season 3, making them less impactful when employed again. The team being disbanded? It’s like the fifth time that we’ve seen that threat. A suspect getting up after being knocked unconscious and causing more havoc because the police officers didn’t bother to cuff him? Yup, not new. The real criminal not being who they initial thought? A Voice series classic. Different minor cases just happen to be related to the main case because it’s convenient for the plot? You bet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The writing is also frustrating because of how incompetent the police force comes across.  I know that the police in South Korea doesn’t have that much power as much of their power was stripped from them after misusing it during the 70’s and 80’s, but the incompetence of the police force on the whole as portrayed in this drama is astonishing. Apparently, nothing is ever locked in a police station and a civilian can waltz in there however they like. Moreover, these police officers weighing around 80 kilos that have no problem handling specially trained assassins in one scene, suddenly struggle to control and being out maneuvered by small men and women weighing around 50-60 kilos in close quarters combat. Furthermore, it has been a recurring problem of the series that a lot of suspects have priors and the police has a bunch of intel on them yet they never run checks on them until they are already on the run and these people can just operate their businesses freely despite their criminal records. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) Starting off the series with a 8 month time skip from the end of season 2 was not very well executed. It makes the character relations feel very disjointed to how they used to act back in season 2. A lot has apparently changed in that time but it isn’t established right off the bat what has happened to make the characters different from how we know them. This makes the characterization feel off. The establishment of exposition isn’t as lazy as in the second season, but it’s halfway there. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) I wish the acting was better than it is. Not only do some side characters have pretty dodgy acting but it also applies to the main characters. The main actress Lee Hana who has been in all three iterations of Voice as call center leader Kang Kwon Joo should do a better job than she does in my opinion. She has had plenty of time to get familiar with the character and figure out how to properly express said character. Her acting is by now means terrible but considering she has 13 years of acting experience, I had higher hopes for her performance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The writing has never been the strong suit of the Voice series and continues to be mediocre in this iteration. The acting in Voice 3 is also weaker than in previous installations. However, this time around the direction is really high quality which saves the drama in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arthdal Chronicles (Season 1) - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Historical fantasy drama about the mythical first kingdom known as Arthdal.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is very ambitious and potentially groundbreaking. I haven’t seen anything like it from a Korean drama ever. The setting of being a historical drama but not taking place during Joseon or Goryeo but rather in a mythical early civilization setting is very unique. This is also the most traditionally fantasy ala Lord of the Rings that a kdrama has ever gotten. The production is a huge gamble in that it’s setting its feet on uncharted territory for Korean productions, which I appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) The cast is really star studded and they mostly do a great job with the acting throughout the series. Song Joong Ki, Kim Ji Won, Jang Dong Gun, and Kim Ok Bin are all decorated and very experienced and talented, which really shows. This drama is no easy task and finding much better actors to tackle it would have been hard. In many scenes, I was struck by how the main actors just commanded presences and jumped out of the screen.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) The set design I find to be very pleasing. Especially the large amount of outdoor sets that are really complex. The outdoor sets also mean that they can be more liberal with their practical effects. I jump out of joy when I see real fire, as it looks so dope compared to digital fire. The real fire also helps create spectacular lighting. I enjoy seeing the flicker of flames on the faces off the actors in tense scenes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) The metaphor of the dujeumsaengs and Neanderthals of being treated like many native people by a majority group or settlers is quite smart. Much like the natives, they think that land shouldn’t or can’t be owned but rather it is something given to man by the gods for everyone to share. Enter the Saram, who proceed to ravage their villages, take away their land and freedom, all for the sake of their own profit. The sentiment isn’t exactly new, as the whole exploitation of nature theme has been explored in other works of fiction like “Pocahontas” and even in other works of fantasy like Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” and Cameron’s “Avatar”, but I enjoy it still.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(5) The drama being pre produced along with having really talented people spearheading it helps a lot with the quality of writing and production. The director for the show is hitmaker Kim Won Suk who has many quality shows under his belt such as &amp;quot;Misaeng&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Signal&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;My Mister&amp;quot;. On the writing side, we find the team of writer Kim Young Hyun and writer Park Sang Yeon who wrote plenty of great historical dramas like &amp;quot;Queen Seon Duk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Tree With Deep Roots&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Six Flying Dragons&amp;quot; together. Both the producer’s and the writers’ track record speaks for themselves as they do just as great of a job in this show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(1) I need a goddamn lore book or wiki for this drama. There is so much information about characters, places, clans, gods and races that are thrown at you at once. I feel like I almost need to read up on all of it or rewatch the episodes multiple times. I understand that the first season needs to be exposition heavy, but sometimes it just becomes a bit to overbearing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(2) Some characters interpretations are a bit too modern for my liking. For instance, Kim Ok Bin’s character Tae Al Ha feels too out of place. Her mannerisms and the way she talks just sounds so modern considering the historical setting. Now, one could argue that this is fantasy so there is no frame of reference for how people of the time actually spoke. However, considering that the rest of the cast that plays the roles of nobles speak with the typical “saeguk-cadence”, Tae Al Ha feels a bit out of place. Whether Tae Al Ha is acted this way because of Kim Ok Bin or the director or someone else on set, we may never know. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(3) There is a LOT of CGI in this drama and it doesn’t always look that good. Some of the time it looks solid, when the lighting and shadows and textures and movement looks as it should look. Most of the time, the effects could have needed some more work. Mainly, some of the backgrounds that are entirely or partly computer generated look a little flat, (see Sea of Tears for instance). Also, the interactions between real actors and environments and CG objects and animals look a little jarring sometimes. The CGI usually looks fine at a distance, but when they show CGI animals or backgrounds up close to the camera or decided to go full CGI camera and 100% digital shot, like the opening shot at The Great Black Cliff, it takes you out of the immersion of the show.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(4) Despite the large budget some of the budget restraints are showing. The costumes, makeup and locations, have been criticized and I can see why. While they look fine enough when just casually watching the show, the flaws start to show once you analyze the series shot by shot. Like I said at the beginning, this show is a huge gamble and in some aspects it shows that the show is a first step toward creating full scale fantasy shows for the Korean market like this one.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - Despite some of its shortcomings, Arthdal Chronicles still is a really good show and only promises to get even more intense in season 2 &amp;amp; 3.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",
