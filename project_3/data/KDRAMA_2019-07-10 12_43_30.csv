[Here comes the spoiler] 


Then those two final episodes happened...


They spent the whole drama trying to solve the case, putting their lives on hold until it was closed, but on the day the judge is going to make the most important pronouncement, the one that will decide the future of the serial killer, the couple is on a date, completely alone, in a park. 


A total of 0 people sent them texts to say the judge digged the serial killer pit and he was probably angry somewhere right now, plotting revenge, so stay inside your house, please. The whole tragedy happens. The police gets there too late, etc. 


So we get to the couch scene, Cha Min disappearing. I said to myself I've seen It somewhere Else. And It was, to my senses, so Goblin like. 


He fades away. She keeps living and waiting for him. We found out later he was walking through the earth alone and in pain until he finds that old guy again, the one who could see him and had an abyss too. 



In this part either I blinked or they never explained how Cha Min got his material body back, who was that old man, if Se-yeon father finally accepted her, what was the abyss, who were those aliens, didn't show Cha Min's mother reaction when he got back home, gave a lonely ending to Hee Jin, and that final ""I am going to the bathroom, hey I am pregnant"" scene made me cringe. 


The drama was on its way to get an A, but the ending felt rushed and thoughtless. I think It could use another two episodes to close things more smoothly.

&lt;p&gt;So we get to the couch scene, Cha Min disappearing. I said to myself I&amp;#39;ve seen It somewhere Else. And It was, to my senses, so Goblin like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fades away. She keeps living and waiting for him. We found out later he was walking through the earth alone and in pain until he finds that old guy again, the one who could see him and had an abyss too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part either I blinked or they never explained how Cha Min got his material body back, who was that old man, if Se-yeon father finally accepted her, what was the abyss, who were those aliens, didn&amp;#39;t show Cha Min&amp;#39;s mother reaction when he got back home, gave a lonely ending to Hee Jin, and that final &amp;quot;I am going to the bathroom, hey I am pregnant&amp;quot; scene made me cringe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama was on its way to get an A, but the ending felt rushed and thoughtless. I think It could use another two episodes to close things more smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts or even explanations my old self totally missed?&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post calculating the probability of our protagonists being the father based on their previous lifestyles, episodic notes, your fruit peeling tips, couple yoga benefits, near-truck experiences or links to your favourite Shin Sung Rok fanpage, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama or got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) (Reddit-wide spoiler tags are also available) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third to last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short-listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second to last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama that can be nominated, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch it, but there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/301-three-dads-one-mom""&gt;Three Dads One Mom.&lt;/a&gt; After covering episodes 1-3 today, we&amp;#39;ll discuss episodes 4-6 on Thursday.

Freegal Music is a service for libraries that allows card holders from the subscribing library to stream/download a certain amount of music every week. For me I can stream ~2 hours free and download 5 songs a week; I’m not sure if that’s standard or just my library’s agreement. Sure it can take a month or two  to get a whole album, but if I couldn’t budget in the purchase in that’s better than nothing!

A couple weeks ago on a whim I searched for some Ailee, not expecting to find anything, but low and behold, while I didn’t find the song I was looking for (not surprising) I did find the OST she did for Memories of the Alhambra. I went down that rabbit hole and found several full OST albums I’d considered buying but never got around to- This Life is My First, Hundred Million Stars from the Sky, and Encounter. I also found some partials - the individual OST release albums for Her Private Life (but not the full album version with all the bg music) and Rachael Yamagata’s songs from Something in the Rain.

Before writing this post I just did an album search for “Original Television Soundtrack,” and scanned for familiar names. Doing this I found Abyss, Mr. Sunshine, Let’s Eat 3, and He is Psychometric. There’s almost definitely more; I didn’t go too far down the list.

Freegal mainly partners with Sony, so probably any OST released under any of their sub labels will end up there. A lot (but not all) of the dramas partially funded by Netflix seem to be there.

Check your library website’s eResources to see if they subscribe to Freegal. Larger, well funded libraries are more likely to subscribe as it’s not cheap for them, but it never hurts to check (or ask)! Even if you’re not into OSTs they have a lot of good stuff there. Might as well get some good music from your taxes. ;)

Can you please help me understand the ending of the series?

*spoilers ahead*
How did SHE GET PREGNANT, they only met for like a day... and its been 3 years since he was gone. So how did she get pregnant real quick. Also, how were they married. Min was gone for 3 years and also of those years Se-yeon was just by herself. 

So how did they get married? And how did she get pregnant the day they just met after 3 years.

Also, WRITERS YOU ARE SO LAZY. THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER ENDING BUT THIS WAS UTTERLY DISGUSTINGLY DISAPPOINTING. 

IN THE BEGINNING THEY WERE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. And now i have even more questions. You are supposed to help me understand the series


Oh 
My 
Gawd

I am so sad.

I still love the series though nonetheless. The ending of this series reminds me of Memories of Alhambra and Meteor Garden ( Cdrama not Kdrama) These three dramas have the weirdest yet most confusing and out of the place ending that only writers or the producers of shows understand.

STILL I recommend this series AND MAKE SURE TO WATCH THIS IF U HAVE TIME TO KILL. i still love PBY and AHS. I really hope this will boost AHS career but since Abyss is getting negative reception. I think it wont help AHS get more recognition. 

Obviously, i still love the series even though the ending confused me.

Please, explain your thoughts and I would love to hear it and lets  help each other try to understand the ending of this series.

Ps. the cute scenes between PBY and AHS. Ah ❤️ it so cute oh my. Their onscreen chemistry made up for everything else. 

Really wish they do better, maybe a season 2 ? But with different writers and same cast. And explain EVERYTHING THAT SEASON 1 DIDNT ANSWER!!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dear kdrama lovers...&lt;/p&gt;

We don&amp;#39;t expect our subtitle translations to change everyone&amp;#39;s name to their first name when it&amp;#39;s said as Mr /Ms last name.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though SITR was what it was, it really made me curious about Korea's culture so I decided to give Misaeng a chance. And now after 1,076 episodes, I'm feeling like I need a break.

The last movie I watched was in December of last year, and I haven't watched the new season of most shows I thought I was addicted to. This is by far my most visited subreddit and kdramas really consume most of my ""free time"". I'm definitely more picky about what to watch, after discovering about the tropes and the fate that a few dramas have that you can notice as soon as you start watching it.

If anything, I think that what made really like kdramas was the humor. I really liked the romance at first because it was more innocent than what we have here in the west, but if I had to pick a moment out of all these dramas I've watched in the past year, it would probably be the 3 second scene where Han Yeo Jin shows a sketch of Hwang Shi Mok to her colleague in the first episode. She looked serious in the posters so seeing her being funny in a situation liked that is something I can't forget.

If you're watching your very first dramas, enjoy it. It will be a fun ride.  I will finish One Spring Night as take a break for a while. I want to miss it.

I know this sub had talked about this show a lot but I have a lot I want to say about it.

For all it's flaws, and there were plenty, SWDBS was truly magical. I had never binged a show before to that degree, watching 3 to 4 episodes a day and conoletely abandoning my duties and responsibilities in real life 😅 but this show was crack and just compulsive viewing.

The chemistry between Hyung-sik and Bo-you was sizzling and oh so real and I loved the prickly and cute banter throughout. This show never took itself too seriously which worked well in its favour.

Park Bo-young was the perfect casting choice for DBS. You wouldn't find a cuter and more petite actress to play DBS and she was perfect. DBS goes down as one of my favourite kdrama characters, just so utterly likeable.

Hyung-sik was also stellar. His ad-libs such as ""Do Intern!"" were fantastic and really added to the comedy. Also his soulful gazes to DBS was on point.

The writing, while not terrible imho, was still the show's weakness as too much time was spent on Boss Taek, his underlings and the fake monk. It almost felt like a medical show at times with the amount of tine spent in the hospital lol. Also Kim Won-hae, while I usually like him, didn't find his character as the gay guy funny.

The serial kidnapper and creepy dude was well acted and the plot was thrilling but it was such a tonal shift from the cute and lighter stuff that it sometimes felt like I was watching a different show. And the kidnapper could have been fleshed out as a character much better.

Also Min-hyuk's family was conveniently forgotten in the second half of the show. I get that you guys aren't on good terms, but to not invite them to your wedding... ?

Despite thise flaws, show won me over and stole my heart. And that's what this show also had, it had heart. The biggest question this show asked us was if DBS would be able to live a normal life as she pleased without having to be a superhero (we still the same question posed to other superhero kdramas City Hunter and Healer). That's why I love the last scene so, so much with her looking over the city she swears to protect and then epically jumping down declaring she is DBS. I wish City Hunter had a similar scene, like of him vowing to protect the city after Young-ju's death rather tham him just driving off in his car.

One last parallel I will make with this show is with What's Wrong with Secretary Kim. Kim Mi-so and DBS both work for their boss as secretaries (DBS as a secretary to cover her identity earlier in the show) but both have ambitions to leave this position (Kim Mi-so wants to quit her job and DBS wants to join the strategy department). In the end they both end up not really fufilling those ambitions, Kim Mi-so still works for Young-joo and DBS was too preoccupied with saving the world. Would you say this is lack of character growth, or have they realised they didn't need what they were striving for?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;*also contains spoilers for City Hunter and What&amp;#39;s Wrong with Secretary Kim&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. 

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

**Wow, 700 responses! Thank you all for participating. Let's try to break 1000 next year?**

   * The census will open back up soon for stragglers or those just joining us.

##Notes:

* So what sort of skews the employment results is that some people selected 'unemployed' and an occupation. Unemployed means that there is no current occupation.

* I think the World Region/Where Do You Live sections are right where they need to be. Thanks for the suggestion to get specific! Really cool to see where everyone is.

* The Race section is what needs tinkering. I have been looking for a more open categorization that keeps things broad but still allows for local identification based on that area's history: White (any origin), Black/African/Caribbean, Asian (includes the Indian subcontinent), Pacific Islander, Arab (any origin), Native/Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino, Mixed Race/Mixed Ethnicity, Other Racial/Ethnic Group(s).

* We're still a bunch of Single Pringles, aren't we? 

* Look at some of y'all with graduate degrees and professional degrees (including the ones who are working on them right now). Go on with your educated selves! Congratulations to everybody for making it through whatever school!

* Weekends are the most popular browsing days. Most of y'all are checking in regularly. 20% are irregular/once a month.

* I'm about to refresh the website choices as well as the how were you introduced to dramas choices so there aren't too many write-ins. Gotta keep up with the times/trends and keep things tidy!

* I love seeing the native languages responses! What a variety this time around.

* Korea travel questions went well. Thanks for the suggestion(s). Keeping these two.

We've been coming up out of the dip and we're over Feb/Mar numbers. The Song-Song Divorce caused a [spike in traffic](https://imgur.com/a/ZSOw5ck) that affected our averages somewhat, but we would already be higher than last month if the numbers held study. We *have* seen daily subscriptions pick up into the 100s (the 11th and on). I don't know what's driving that, but I don't expect it to dip down next month.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been coming up out of the dip and we&amp;#39;re over Feb/Mar numbers. The Song-Song Divorce caused a &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/ZSOw5ck""&gt;spike in traffic&lt;/a&gt; that affected our averages somewhat, but we would already be higher than last month if the numbers held study. We &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen daily subscriptions pick up into the 100s (the 11th and on). I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s driving that, but I don&amp;#39;t expect it to dip down next month.&lt;/p&gt;

I [resign from my position](https://i.imgur.com/vjyhkVJ.jpg) as Weekly Binge host [effective immediately](https://i.imgur.com/rPsoa9R.jpg). I’ve [packed up my desk](https://i.imgur.com/WLsXOJs.jpg), no need to [help with my bags](https://i.imgur.com/6bdyRh9.png) on the way out. Watch out, [I'm taking the stairs](https://i.imgur.com/86gTzSs.png), there’s no way am I riding in [that hellevator](https://i.imgur.com/dfWXtLE.jpg). But don’t worry, I’ve accepted the fact that [I too am replaceable](https://i.imgur.com/dLPP4Yq.png). I’m leaving you all in u/AlohaAlex’s [very capable hands](https://giphy.com/gifs/jq0QFKN6bcstkmGE4G/tile) and I don’t think he’s the type to let the [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRv8ZBLuW0) go to his head although [I’m biased af](https://i.imgur.com/COR9lad.png). I might be [a little bored](https://i.imgur.com/Mj8JH5e.png) so if you see me on the streets [say hi](https://i.imgur.com/liKzBN9.png) or [pretend you don’t know me](https://i.imgur.com/ZJSBHdE.png), [I’ll leave it up to you](https://i.imgur.com/cVb2wtj.png). I’ll be [willing to come back in the future](https://i.imgur.com/HPxnLGh.png), if a big enough offer is on the table and [greet you all with open arms](https://i.imgur.com/dMzFC3f.png).

The second to last part of the review series is here! For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.

As usual, let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**April**

&amp;#x200B;

**My Fellow Citizens - KBS2**

Political satirical comedy drama about a conman who suddenly is forced to run for a spot at the National Assembly.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) There is a lot of smart humor in this show. In between the usual humor you would find in kdramas such as slapstick and cheap gags, you find nuggets of biting yet really funny social satire regarding modern politics. It treads the line between wacky and intelligent perfectly. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's not afraid to mock and criticize potentially controversial topics.

The show sometimes even treads the line of a black comedy but ends up balancing having a loan shark villain in a comedy series by making her and her accomplices quite bad at being villains, making even their murderous attempts quite humorous. Said loan shark, Park Hoo Ja played by Kim Min Jung, has a lot of great moments as she is clearly evil but also has some growing pains filling her dad's shoes. I find it hilarious how she has super convoluted plans to achieve her goals, how she sucks at both golf and pool, and how she always breathes a sigh of relief whenever the one whom she extorts leaves and she doesn't have to put up a facade of being a calm villain. All in all, it is a brilliant character and performance.

(2) The dialogue is razor sharp where many conversations between characters feel like an all out war. Many of the characters are quite verbally aggressive toward one another, constantly provoking and trying to one up each other. Interestingly enough, the characters show their verbal aggression in different ways. Some characters like the protagonist Yang Jung Gook played by Choi Siwon are loud and raise hell while some other characters are coy, sly or passive aggressive. I think this style of dialogue fits well with the drama considering it’s about politics and much of the debate in politics is a figurative war with words. 

(3) The show asks a lot of interesting questions to the viewer and is quite thought provoking. For instance, it asks the question whether it’s the corrupt who seek power, or if power is what corrupts. Congressman Kim Joo Myung played by Kim Eui Sang, who was once a bright eyed idealist didn’t enter politics as someone corrupt, rather politics turned him corrupt. The same goes for Han Sang Jin played by Tae In Ho. However, Yang Jung Kook was forced into politics already being a corrupt soul and it made him aspire to do something other than scam people. Instead of relying on his con man ways, which works just fine if you want to become a politician who just feeds the people lies, he wants to use politics as a tool to help people. In a way, politics turned him into an idealist just like Joo Myung and Sang Jin once were. This shows the duality of politics and power. Maybe it is not power that absolutely corrupts, but rather how you use that power.  

There are also connections between the drama and the theory of public choice. It shows many of the aspects that self interested agents in the political field deal with. For instance, it shows that even though a politician knows what is for example the best economic choice, they will stray away from that as gaining voting followers is more important to them. They serve their own interests through their choices even though they are aware of what is the better choice, instead they go with the more popular choice. It also shows how different lobby groups work in order to get politicians to make policy decisions that will benefit their interest group. 

(4) They use some really cool shots throughout the show. While it is not all original ideas, it is still cool to see them using other people’s work as inspiration and integrating it to their own series. One example of this where I screamed “That’s the Tarantino angle!”, is when they film a bunch of characters looking into a safe and it is made to look like it’s being filmed from within the safe with all the characters looking into the camera. 

There are some other great moments where characters intentionally break the rule of “don’t look into the camera” for comedic effect and break the fourth wall while delivering messages to the watcher, while in the context of the scene also talking to another character opposite them. Big props to director Kim Jung Hyun for his creativity with the camera shots.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The lack of realism is sometimes used just for cheap thrills. I’m fine with unrealistic plot points when it is set up as a deliberate joke or for wacky comedy purposes but when it is supposed to be taken seriously it just makes me question the writing. For instance, the election results scene bothers me quite a bit in this regard. &gt;!In a real election, once 20% of votes are counted you get a pretty accurate portrayal of what the final result will look like and comebacks where someone only has half the votes of the winning candidate at this point are highly unlikely. However, my main problem with this is not it’s statistical unlikeliness. My main problem is that it feels like the reproduction of the trope from sports movies where the underdog makes an extremely unlikely comeback. Overall, this plot point was just not very well thought out or executed as it uses unrealistic writing to poor effect.!&lt;

(2) The series requires some major suspension of disbelief to not question the premise of it. Like, how does Lee Yoo Young’s character Mi Young not catch on to her husband Jung Gook being a con artist? She is a detective and people tell her and more or less give away the fact that he is a con man. She ought to be more doubtful and suspicious of him. The counter argument towards this would be that she is in denial and refuses to see the truth even when it is right in front of her. If that would be the case, then I would have liked some scenes showing her reaching that state of denial, how she figures out the truth but ultimately convinces herself that her husband can’t possibly be a con man.

(3) Some characters are introduced early on in the series and then it takes forever before they become important to the plot or are seen on screen again at all. The prime example of this is the oldest sister of Hoo Ja, who was introduced in episode 10 and then not mentioned again until episode 28. It feels really disjointed and makes it obvious that the introduction scene exists purely for exposition purposes.

(4) The ending was quite flat as there were simply too many different plot lines and characters to be able to give them all a fleshed out ending to their character arcs and stories. This is the backside of having quite a large plot with tons of characters that doesn’t run out of steam. You need to cover everything in this rather large plot in only 18 hours, which is a hard task to face. Unfortunately, this resulted in the ending feeling rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 9,0 / 10* \- The series has some major flaws but the uniqueness of it and all it strengths still make for an excellent drama. It probably won’t make the history books as one of the most influential or popular dramas of the year, but it will remain a personal favorite of mine for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Beautiful World - JTBC**

Melodrama about a school violence case that ends up with one middle school boy in a coma while his parents seek the truth of what really happened.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) This drama is probably the most emotional and gripping one of the year so far. It paints a very nuanced picture of bullying by not just portraying the bullies as pure evil but rather showing that they are products of their surrounding (mainly their parents), which I commend it for. There are a lot of heart wrenching scenes in this drama that are likely to drain you emotionally. As a future teacher, this hit especially close to home as the problems of bullying and school violence are unfortunately going to be occurrences that I will have to deal with in my future career. The one scene that really stands out in my mind is the beginning of episode 3 when it becomes clear to the viewer how vile the situation is and contrasts it with the parents happy memories of their now comatosed child. What baffles me is that this isn’t even the hardest or tragic scene to sit through. That would be the reveal of what actually happened to &gt;!the little depressed girl Da Hae!&lt;, as those scenes made me feel things that I cannot even put into words. The closest I’ll get to a description is “severely sick to my stomach”.

(2) The cinematography is really visually interesting. They sometimes go a bit overboard with it and can be a bit distracting, but I’d rather see a show that actually tries to have artistic merit than one that has really plain visual appeal. They try really hard and I appreciate the effort. The shots through the glass walls and windows in Joon Seok’s house work as great visual cues, showing when characters are divided or united. In many scenes we see Joon Seok’s father occupying the larger space of the window whereas the rest of the family are confined to smaller spaces, clearly showing that he is the one wielding the power. Probably my favorite shot of the entire series is Joon Seok’s father looking at his son through a windowpane that is shaped like a clock, indicating “like father, like son”, that although time passes, the same values, morals and evil has been transferred from grandfather, to father, to son.   

(3) The drama is a prime subject for sociological analysis, which is a great indication that the writers did a good job of writing believable characters with very human traits and responses. The authorities in this drama reminds me of the future of the dystopian vision that Max Weber held of an absolute bureaucracy, where the individuals holding authority are just a cog in the machinery and feel little to no personable responsibility for the lives of others. They are just following protocol to make sure the machinery keeps running smoothly. Other interesting parallels can be drawn to Goffman’s theories about stigma and coping with stigma as well as Durkheim’s ideas of a hierarchy of consensus.

(4) The drama incorporates references to J.D. Salinger's classic ”Catcher in the Rye” and manages to put an interesting spin on the original novel with its interpretation of it. By no means are the plots similar to one another but they carry many of the same messages when interpreting the novel within the context of the drama.

(5) The dialogue is full of subtext and much of what the characters actually say isn’t actually what they think and feel, as the traumatic events that have unfolded are so hard to talk out loud about. They work the whole trope of “lack of communication between characters” in a smart way as their problems could be solved by honesty but the stigma is way too strong to actually tell the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) Although the drama is well written, the story moves at a snail’s pace. The drama contains well thought out plot points but they are spaced too far from each other which results in the plot ending up being quite thin. It also takes so long to get any sort of pay off from all the suffering as there are so many obstacles in the way for the plot to get moving along and it is left stomping in the same place for very long, though when the payoff finally comes it feels worth it. The plot is mostly predictable despite how complex it is, which makes the slow pacing even more tedious as you sit and wait patiently only for your predictions to all come true.

(2) The melodrama is so heavy that you need to be in a very certain mood to enjoy the show. At the same time, trying to binge watch this show is not a great idea unless you have slightly masochistic tendencies. It’s not the kind of drama that provides some healthy crying either, rather it leaves you with a hole in your chest and an unsettling feeling in your stomach. Don’t expect to go into this drama and keep a happy mood for the rest of the day, as watching this drama includes a lot of suffering. This is both a strength but also a weakness of the drama as it is not very multi-purpose and you need to pick your viewing sessions of this show well.

(3) Even though I complimented the drama for being visually interesting, I don’t think the cinematography is that good at reinforcing the portrayal of themes and emotions throughout the drama. For instance, I’m not a big fan of how they use voyeuristic camera angles in their shots even when there is no one listening in on the conversation or to indicate that the setting is enclosed, voyeuristic and lacking in privacy. Examples of directors using such shots excellently to establish and reinforce the setting is Wong Kar Wai’s ”In The Mood For Love” (2000) and Alfred Hitchcock’s ”Rear Window” (1954). The setting in this drama is rather the opposite, yes people gossip a lot about the lives of others but it’s not because they have insight into their lives but instead because they lack insight. The people in this drama are isolated from one another, as the worlds of different families are separated and the world of the adolescents is separated from the world of the adults.

The show also uses so many over the shoulder shots. I get it since the show is so dialogue-heavy, but there are other angles and perspectives you can use to spice things up. Whenever they do a close up or a wide shot during the dialogue, it feels really refreshing. Therefore, I wish they would mix things up a little more when it comes to the camera angles during character dialogue.

(4) Even though the acting is good for the most part, it is quite inconsistent as some actors have some shaky performances.  As it is a story of an event taking place at a middle school, there are a lot of child actors who are somewhat hit or miss. Some of the adult actors are also prone to over-acting. Overacting is not always bad as it can be used for comedic effect or mockery, for instance, see Kim Byung Chul’s character in “SKY Castle” (2018) where he is overacting to make a mockery out of the typical patriarchal father. They try to make a similar mockery of stereotypical characters in this drama, like the vice principal who only thinks about his promotion played by Jang Jae Sung and the rabid helicopter mom played by Kang Mal Geum, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. Choo Ja Hyun as Seon Ho’s mom tends to overact quite a bit as well, as there are more nuanced ways of expressing sadness than just wailing in every other scene.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- It is a gripping and emotional story but the pacing is rather slow and some of the acting and cinematography feels misplaced. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Labor Inspector Jo - MBC** 

Social satire, comedy, crime drama about a labor inspector who is out to punish business owners who treat their workers poorly.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The premise and the subject matter is really good and the show manages to be really heartfelt at points. It showcases the grim reality the working and middle class of Korea have to deal with in a believable manner. The depiction of how the chain of blame works is excellent. The chairman lashes out at the CEO who lashes out at his subordinates. It gives you some perspective on the psychology of bosses. The depictions of how workers cope with difficult working conditions is also really nice, whether it be destructive ways of coping like alcoholism or strengthening ways of coping like through love and family. 

(2) Ryu Deok Hwan plays the lawyer Woo Do Ha, who is like the eye of the storm, perfectly. The character has such gravitos because he doesn’t need to get aggressive or make any grand displays to showcase his power. He rarely loses his cool and stays ice cold no matter how crazy a situation gets. These types of antagonists are the scariest of all as they can be all civilized and polite while planning to end you. Incredible performance of a really intriguing character. Oh, and did I mention that the actor is also a screenwriter, director and has 25 years of acting experience, at the mere age of 31? Kid’s got talent.

(3) The payoff for whenever any bad guys get put in their place is definitely worth all the build up and feels very satisfying. If you are the type of person to enjoy these “sticking it to the man” stories then this drama is something for you.

(4) The drama gets a lot better in the second half where the stakes are higher and the cases become increasingly personal and pressing for the main cast. No longer are complicated relationships in the past the point of conflict but rather current issues that affect the lives of near and dear characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) There are too many flashbacks of the same scenes and events. They rarely add any new information and just indicate that the writer thinks their audience is too stupid to follow along the story. Too many unnecessary fake outs and reveals of plot information that was hidden away from the viewer, when said reveal is not even that impactful to the story. At other times, they have already shown us the result of an event and then show the flashback which takes all the suspense out of the flashback. This all boils down to decisions in editing that weren’t always the best. Speaking of the editing, the editing of the initial episodes of the drama makes the setup of it really hard to follow as they don’t introduce characters before putting them in important scenes.

(2) There is not very good attention to detail throughout the drama. There are a surprising amount of continuity errors. It’s up to the set designer and editing to make sure that these don’t occur. I imagine that working on the sets and in the editing room of kdramas is very stressful so these kinds of errors are understandable. However, they still impact the overall quality of the drama. One example of this is when an office worker drops a stack of papers on the floor in one shot and in the next, said papers are several meters away. Also, I understand using CGI for small details such as a bug in a dirty kitchen is overkill, but you have to use better props than a plastic toy bought at a toy store. The only way you get away with having such cheap props is if you brush it off as a joke, but that’s about it.

(3) The drama includes a pretty poor depiction of a suicide attempt. The scene is done in such a casual manner, almost making light of it with how non-dramatic it is.  I know there is a law against graphic depictions of the moment of suicide in Korean broadcasting regulations, but I feel like depictions of suicide need to be more dramatic than what they did in this drama. Of course, romanticizing suicide is not something a filmmaker should do either, but it certainly requires a serious execution. 

(4) One of the golden rules of storytelling is ”show don’t tell”, which I feel this show could have done better. The show rarely lets events speak for themselves and instead have the characters monologue afterwards about why said event is unethical. “Show don’t tell” is especially important in a satire based show where telling someone the message and the point over and over again can end up feeling preachy, instead of enlightening. 

(5) Speaking of which, satire and comedy are almost entirely separated in this drama. Sure there are some good ironic jokes that are not in your face, like the corrupt “Clean Governor”, possibly being a comment on that people and governments who feel the need to call themselves clean and democratic usually are the most corrupt. Overall though, the satire is very serious throughout and the comedy is used for comic relief purposes in order to keep the drama from getting too dark and brooding. In my opinion, this style of satire is worse than a tongue-in-cheek satire as the writers can get away with less social criticism while being serious and can often come across as pushing an agenda or a message way too hard on its viewers. As the message is often constituted by platitudes as well, the satire becomes very watered down and safe, which is the opposite purpose of satire. You want it to be provoking, so that it can spawn a debate regarding the issues at hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 6,5 / 10* \- The premise and the subject matter are definitely really good and the drama builds to become a lot better towards the back half but the editing mistakes and choices along with the overtness of the comedy-less satire and the message it is trying to put forth makes the drama drop off in quality, at least to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Her Private Life - TvN**

Romcom, slice of life drama about a painter who meets a curator by profession, fangirl by lifestyle, whereupon they fall in love at work.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The color grading in the drama is really visually pleasing, making each color pop. As there is so much focus on color and how it is assigned and associated with different characters, it fits perfectly here. How this is done is that you isolate a certain color and then you grade them individually in a digital program to create different effects. In combination with the set design often having quite neutral backgrounds it allows for certain colors to really stand out. 

(2) The main leads have so many great scenes together thanks to good editing choices, acting and writing. The silence in intimate scenes is really effectful. It creates so much more tension than just blasting “romantic/emotional” music. It really gives the chemistry between the two leads room to shine and boy does it shine. Kim Jae Wook as Ryan Gold and Park Min Young as Sung Deok Mi both do a fantastic job at portraying a couple that is truly in love. Park Min Young is experienced in being the leading lady in romcoms and always puts up a good performance, whereas Kim Jae Wook really surprised with this being his first real romcom and yet he knocked it out of the park. The writing of the main characters really help as well since the couple is written to be reliant on each other but still keep their own autonomy. I really enjoy that they feel like equals in their relationship. Yes, Ryan is technically Deok Mi’s boss but it rarely feels like he uses his position to force Deok Mi things she wouldn’t otherwise do. They are both respectful towards each other and impossibly cute together. 

(3) “Her Private Life” reminds me a lot of shoujo manga/anime or a Jane Austen novel in its storytelling. A lot of the story is just looking into the mind of the main female protagonist and getting to know her emotions, her longing and her dreams. Much of the interesting parts of this character driven drama takes place in their minds and it is visualized very well through the scenes of the fantasy scenarios of different characters and what happens on the fan page Deok Mi runs.

There are some slice of life aspects to the show which means it has a quiet and slow type of story focusing on rather ordinary people. It's not meant to be an epic love story or heartbreaking melodrama, and it doesn't throw in a crime subplot just for the heck of it. Some might view this type of story as boring, I see it as endearing and charming.

(4) Some of the product placement is really well done. The Canon cameras are among the most natural product placement I’ve seen in kdrama. Great choice of sponsor and they make the products essentially an accessory that fits in the story with both the fangirling aspect of the show as well as the photography/art side of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) Although the Canon product placement is done well, a lot of product placement in this drama is very in your face without any integration into the story or subtlety. I understand that unless the drama is a historical one, there will be product placement. However, there are creative and good ways to incorporate it into the drama, like they did with the Canon cameras. At times, the sponsorships of the drama are really aggravating and in your face which impacts the enjoyability of the drama.

(2) Some of the characters outside of the main couple are shallowly written. The “brother” character Eun Gi has some really shallow writing and very few character traits. He likes judo and Deok Mi, that’s it. The actor Ahn Bohyun who plays Eun Gi is also a noticeably less experienced actor with this being one of his first main roles. This really shows in the scenes with the family when being on screen at the same time as Deok Mi’s parents played by Kim Mi Kyung and Maeng Sang Hoon, both of which are fantastic. There are other very shallowly written characters in the drama as well such as Da In. However, since she at least knows what she is doing to keep Ryan and Deok Mi from each other is wrong, as well as her being a supporting character, unlike Eun Gi, I am more forgiving about her character. 

(3) The camera work frustrates me at times. In some of the intimate scenes between Deok Mi and Ryan they keep spinning the camera around the couple, breaking the 180 degree rule multiple times and making the viewer disoriented and almost dizzy. I get that they are trying to be dramatic about their kissing but I would liked it better if they toned it down just a bit in favor of better camera work. 

(4) The last quarter of the drama really drops off in terms of writing. Who asked for a &gt;!prolonged childhood connection and backstory!&lt; arc? Not me, that’s for sure. Since the drama is adapted from the novel “Noona fan dot com” (2007) and I haven’t read the novel, I’m not sure if this unnecessary part of the story is a byproduct of making a faithful adaptation or not. Nevertheless, there are a lot of other more interesting things they could have explored such as &gt;!Ryan’s inability to paint and following his rehabilitation helped by Deok Mi, instead of just having him miraculously be able to paint again.!&lt; Even if they were dead set on having &gt;!the childhood backstory !&lt;arc play out, they could have executed it way better as it currently requires a lot of suspension of disbelief and doesn’t add anything important to the characterization of the characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- This drama is a really great romcom drama that unfortunately falls off a fair bit towards the last quarter of the show. On the whole, it is still a very enjoyable drama.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My First First Love (Season 1) - Netflix**

A coming of age, slice of life, romance drama about a group of college aged friends who end up living together and experience love, friendship and life as young adults.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The first episode does a really excellent job of establishing the characters and the setting and keeping a good balance between exposition and hooking the viewer in. To start with, the cinematography really keeps up with the urgency of the story. The scenes flow into each other in a very natural way, which I think is a byproduct of not having commercial breaks. We are shown the different characters’ backgrounds and their variation in socioeconomic status and yet they all end up in the same place as they all have pretty good motivations for leaving home.

(2) For the most part, I really like the cinematography. I enjoy how some shots linger after the characters go off-screen and then fades into a flashback from the same place is exquisite film making. Sure it’s been done before by why not borrow inspiration if it works?

I also like the amount of extreme close ups they use to really emphasis the actions of characters in certain shots. It can be such ordinary things as opening a bag or twisting the accelerator on the scooter or something as moving as wiping someone’s tears away. It makes the drama feel more alive as there is more motion in the frame and allows for some sequences with fast cuts to add to the motion.  

The drama also makes good use of the basics of different angled shots. When the characters are down on their luck it shows us them from above looking down on them making us see them as vulnerable. When they are standing up for someone it shows us them from below looking up on the which makes them look powerful. It is also used in conversations when the angle switches depending on the mood of the current speaker when one character is sad and the other is happy, which is pretty clever.

(3) The continuity control is pretty tight in this drama, well done to the script supervisor for making sure it is pretty free from any continuity errors. The level of drinks in non-opaque glasses tend to stay the same, a character who gets hit actually has marks from it later on and there are no major flubs with any props as far as I noticed.

(4) The story is set up to turn out in two different ways in season 2, both of which would be quite interesting. As it is a remake of the 2015 drama ”Because this is the first time”, the writer could choose to keep the original ending from that drama which is a pretty unique ending in the context of kdramas. However, they could also decide to change the ending to be different than the original drama which I would see as surprising but still plausible. No matter which route they decided to go down, I will be happy either way.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) As it is a season 1, it ends on a cliffhanger and we will have to wait for the resolve until the release of season 2 which has its official release date set to July 26. They’ve had the entire drama filmed already and the reason for splitting it into two parts is probably to give time for post production to do their magic as well as build up hype for the ending of the series.

(2) I wish they would chill with the lens flare and the super bright color grading. It’s like every time there is sun outside they feel the need to use lens flares and if the sun is coming in through a window, they use really bright filters in post production to drown the characters in light. This is clearly a stylistic choice and while I respect their choice, I don’t agree with it personally. It’s just not an aesthetic that I tend to be drawn towards as it creates less depth within a picture as the contours don’t show as well. 

(3) The roles that the main cast play aren’t the most challenging. Ji Soo is the one who shines the brightest but it feels like the role of Tae Oh is not letting him live up to his potential. The one role that required the most range was Jung Chaeyeon’s role as Song-i but I don’t feel like she delivered as well as I wished. For instance, Song-i’s most emotional and hard hitting scene is the bridge scene in episode 2. It’s good, but mainly thanks to the lines being really well written and the context of the scene rather than Chaeyeon’s performance being spectacular.

(4) The character Se Hyon is just such a drag and we have to wait until next season until we find out why she is so unlikable to everyone around her. It’s a bit of a shame for the actress who plays her, Hong Ji Yoon, as she tends to be typecast to play vain and antagonistic characters. As it stands, her motivations are never made clear and she exists merely to be a pebble in Song-i’s shoe. I have a feeling her character might also have the purpose of teaching Tae Oh a valuable lesson about love. &gt;!In his desperate search for a girlfriend who is everything he dreamed of, he only finds pain and potentially even loses the girl he has always been truly in love with in order to seek a perfect love that doesn’t exist.!&lt; However, this remains to be seen in the second season and until it is revealed what her character arc is like, her character feels like a bit of a hollow shell.

(5) As the show has a heavy romance focus, the characters who are not part of any romance get a bit shafted for story development and screen time despite being main characters. The characters Choi Hoon and especially Oh Ga Rin suffer from this and for a drama with an ensemble cast to work really well, all the characters in the ensemble have to get the chance to shine.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,0 / 10* \- It’s a well shot drama with a quiet everyday story. It’s not fantastic and it does have its flaws but overall it does a good job of portraying young adult romance and friendships. I can imagine this drama being a good palate cleanser after watching something intense.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second to last part of the review series is here! For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, let&amp;#39;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Fellow Citizens - KBS2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political satirical comedy drama about a conman who suddenly is forced to run for a spot at the National Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There is a lot of smart humor in this show. In between the usual humor you would find in kdramas such as slapstick and cheap gags, you find nuggets of biting yet really funny social satire regarding modern politics. It treads the line between wacky and intelligent perfectly. It doesn&amp;#39;t take itself too seriously and it&amp;#39;s not afraid to mock and criticize potentially controversial topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show sometimes even treads the line of a black comedy but ends up balancing having a loan shark villain in a comedy series by making her and her accomplices quite bad at being villains, making even their murderous attempts quite humorous. Said loan shark, Park Hoo Ja played by Kim Min Jung, has a lot of great moments as she is clearly evil but also has some growing pains filling her dad&amp;#39;s shoes. I find it hilarious how she has super convoluted plans to achieve her goals, how she sucks at both golf and pool, and how she always breathes a sigh of relief whenever the one whom she extorts leaves and she doesn&amp;#39;t have to put up a facade of being a calm villain. All in all, it is a brilliant character and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The dialogue is razor sharp where many conversations between characters feel like an all out war. Many of the characters are quite verbally aggressive toward one another, constantly provoking and trying to one up each other. Interestingly enough, the characters show their verbal aggression in different ways. Some characters like the protagonist Yang Jung Gook played by Choi Siwon are loud and raise hell while some other characters are coy, sly or passive aggressive. I think this style of dialogue fits well with the drama considering it’s about politics and much of the debate in politics is a figurative war with words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The show asks a lot of interesting questions to the viewer and is quite thought provoking. For instance, it asks the question whether it’s the corrupt who seek power, or if power is what corrupts. Congressman Kim Joo Myung played by Kim Eui Sang, who was once a bright eyed idealist didn’t enter politics as someone corrupt, rather politics turned him corrupt. The same goes for Han Sang Jin played by Tae In Ho. However, Yang Jung Kook was forced into politics already being a corrupt soul and it made him aspire to do something other than scam people. Instead of relying on his con man ways, which works just fine if you want to become a politician who just feeds the people lies, he wants to use politics as a tool to help people. In a way, politics turned him into an idealist just like Joo Myung and Sang Jin once were. This shows the duality of politics and power. Maybe it is not power that absolutely corrupts, but rather how you use that power.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also connections between the drama and the theory of public choice. It shows many of the aspects that self interested agents in the political field deal with. For instance, it shows that even though a politician knows what is for example the best economic choice, they will stray away from that as gaining voting followers is more important to them. They serve their own interests through their choices even though they are aware of what is the better choice, instead they go with the more popular choice. It also shows how different lobby groups work in order to get politicians to make policy decisions that will benefit their interest group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) They use some really cool shots throughout the show. While it is not all original ideas, it is still cool to see them using other people’s work as inspiration and integrating it to their own series. One example of this where I screamed “That’s the Tarantino angle!”, is when they film a bunch of characters looking into a safe and it is made to look like it’s being filmed from within the safe with all the characters looking into the camera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other great moments where characters intentionally break the rule of “don’t look into the camera” for comedic effect and break the fourth wall while delivering messages to the watcher, while in the context of the scene also talking to another character opposite them. Big props to director Kim Jung Hyun for his creativity with the camera shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The lack of realism is sometimes used just for cheap thrills. I’m fine with unrealistic plot points when it is set up as a deliberate joke or for wacky comedy purposes but when it is supposed to be taken seriously it just makes me question the writing. For instance, the election results scene bothers me quite a bit in this regard. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In a real election, once 20% of votes are counted you get a pretty accurate portrayal of what the final result will look like and comebacks where someone only has half the votes of the winning candidate at this point are highly unlikely. However, my main problem with this is not it’s statistical unlikeliness. My main problem is that it feels like the reproduction of the trope from sports movies where the underdog makes an extremely unlikely comeback. Overall, this plot point was just not very well thought out or executed as it uses unrealistic writing to poor effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The series requires some major suspension of disbelief to not question the premise of it. Like, how does Lee Yoo Young’s character Mi Young not catch on to her husband Jung Gook being a con artist? She is a detective and people tell her and more or less give away the fact that he is a con man. She ought to be more doubtful and suspicious of him. The counter argument towards this would be that she is in denial and refuses to see the truth even when it is right in front of her. If that would be the case, then I would have liked some scenes showing her reaching that state of denial, how she figures out the truth but ultimately convinces herself that her husband can’t possibly be a con man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some characters are introduced early on in the series and then it takes forever before they become important to the plot or are seen on screen again at all. The prime example of this is the oldest sister of Hoo Ja, who was introduced in episode 10 and then not mentioned again until episode 28. It feels really disjointed and makes it obvious that the introduction scene exists purely for exposition purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The ending was quite flat as there were simply too many different plot lines and characters to be able to give them all a fleshed out ending to their character arcs and stories. This is the backside of having quite a large plot with tons of characters that doesn’t run out of steam. You need to cover everything in this rather large plot in only 18 hours, which is a hard task to face. Unfortunately, this resulted in the ending feeling rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 9,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The series has some major flaws but the uniqueness of it and all it strengths still make for an excellent drama. It probably won’t make the history books as one of the most influential or popular dramas of the year, but it will remain a personal favorite of mine for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful World - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melodrama about a school violence case that ends up with one middle school boy in a coma while his parents seek the truth of what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is probably the most emotional and gripping one of the year so far. It paints a very nuanced picture of bullying by not just portraying the bullies as pure evil but rather showing that they are products of their surrounding (mainly their parents), which I commend it for. There are a lot of heart wrenching scenes in this drama that are likely to drain you emotionally. As a future teacher, this hit especially close to home as the problems of bullying and school violence are unfortunately going to be occurrences that I will have to deal with in my future career. The one scene that really stands out in my mind is the beginning of episode 3 when it becomes clear to the viewer how vile the situation is and contrasts it with the parents happy memories of their now comatosed child. What baffles me is that this isn’t even the hardest or tragic scene to sit through. That would be the reveal of what actually happened to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the little depressed girl Da Hae&lt;/span&gt;, as those scenes made me feel things that I cannot even put into words. The closest I’ll get to a description is “severely sick to my stomach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The cinematography is really visually interesting. They sometimes go a bit overboard with it and can be a bit distracting, but I’d rather see a show that actually tries to have artistic merit than one that has really plain visual appeal. They try really hard and I appreciate the effort. The shots through the glass walls and windows in Joon Seok’s house work as great visual cues, showing when characters are divided or united. In many scenes we see Joon Seok’s father occupying the larger space of the window whereas the rest of the family are confined to smaller spaces, clearly showing that he is the one wielding the power. Probably my favorite shot of the entire series is Joon Seok’s father looking at his son through a windowpane that is shaped like a clock, indicating “like father, like son”, that although time passes, the same values, morals and evil has been transferred from grandfather, to father, to son.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The drama is a prime subject for sociological analysis, which is a great indication that the writers did a good job of writing believable characters with very human traits and responses. The authorities in this drama reminds me of the future of the dystopian vision that Max Weber held of an absolute bureaucracy, where the individuals holding authority are just a cog in the machinery and feel little to no personable responsibility for the lives of others. They are just following protocol to make sure the machinery keeps running smoothly. Other interesting parallels can be drawn to Goffman’s theories about stigma and coping with stigma as well as Durkheim’s ideas of a hierarchy of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The drama incorporates references to J.D. Salinger&amp;#39;s classic ”Catcher in the Rye” and manages to put an interesting spin on the original novel with its interpretation of it. By no means are the plots similar to one another but they carry many of the same messages when interpreting the novel within the context of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The dialogue is full of subtext and much of what the characters actually say isn’t actually what they think and feel, as the traumatic events that have unfolded are so hard to talk out loud about. They work the whole trope of “lack of communication between characters” in a smart way as their problems could be solved by honesty but the stigma is way too strong to actually tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the drama is well written, the story moves at a snail’s pace. The drama contains well thought out plot points but they are spaced too far from each other which results in the plot ending up being quite thin. It also takes so long to get any sort of pay off from all the suffering as there are so many obstacles in the way for the plot to get moving along and it is left stomping in the same place for very long, though when the payoff finally comes it feels worth it. The plot is mostly predictable despite how complex it is, which makes the slow pacing even more tedious as you sit and wait patiently only for your predictions to all come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The melodrama is so heavy that you need to be in a very certain mood to enjoy the show. At the same time, trying to binge watch this show is not a great idea unless you have slightly masochistic tendencies. It’s not the kind of drama that provides some healthy crying either, rather it leaves you with a hole in your chest and an unsettling feeling in your stomach. Don’t expect to go into this drama and keep a happy mood for the rest of the day, as watching this drama includes a lot of suffering. This is both a strength but also a weakness of the drama as it is not very multi-purpose and you need to pick your viewing sessions of this show well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Even though I complimented the drama for being visually interesting, I don’t think the cinematography is that good at reinforcing the portrayal of themes and emotions throughout the drama. For instance, I’m not a big fan of how they use voyeuristic camera angles in their shots even when there is no one listening in on the conversation or to indicate that the setting is enclosed, voyeuristic and lacking in privacy. Examples of directors using such shots excellently to establish and reinforce the setting is Wong Kar Wai’s ”In The Mood For Love” (2000) and Alfred Hitchcock’s ”Rear Window” (1954). The setting in this drama is rather the opposite, yes people gossip a lot about the lives of others but it’s not because they have insight into their lives but instead because they lack insight. The people in this drama are isolated from one another, as the worlds of different families are separated and the world of the adolescents is separated from the world of the adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show also uses so many over the shoulder shots. I get it since the show is so dialogue-heavy, but there are other angles and perspectives you can use to spice things up. Whenever they do a close up or a wide shot during the dialogue, it feels really refreshing. Therefore, I wish they would mix things up a little more when it comes to the camera angles during character dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Even though the acting is good for the most part, it is quite inconsistent as some actors have some shaky performances.  As it is a story of an event taking place at a middle school, there are a lot of child actors who are somewhat hit or miss. Some of the adult actors are also prone to over-acting. Overacting is not always bad as it can be used for comedic effect or mockery, for instance, see Kim Byung Chul’s character in “SKY Castle” (2018) where he is overacting to make a mockery out of the typical patriarchal father. They try to make a similar mockery of stereotypical characters in this drama, like the vice principal who only thinks about his promotion played by Jang Jae Sung and the rabid helicopter mom played by Kang Mal Geum, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. Choo Ja Hyun as Seon Ho’s mom tends to overact quite a bit as well, as there are more nuanced ways of expressing sadness than just wailing in every other scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is a gripping and emotional story but the pacing is rather slow and some of the acting and cinematography feels misplaced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Labor Inspector Jo - MBC&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social satire, comedy, crime drama about a labor inspector who is out to punish business owners who treat their workers poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The premise and the subject matter is really good and the show manages to be really heartfelt at points. It showcases the grim reality the working and middle class of Korea have to deal with in a believable manner. The depiction of how the chain of blame works is excellent. The chairman lashes out at the CEO who lashes out at his subordinates. It gives you some perspective on the psychology of bosses. The depictions of how workers cope with difficult working conditions is also really nice, whether it be destructive ways of coping like alcoholism or strengthening ways of coping like through love and family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Ryu Deok Hwan plays the lawyer Woo Do Ha, who is like the eye of the storm, perfectly. The character has such gravitos because he doesn’t need to get aggressive or make any grand displays to showcase his power. He rarely loses his cool and stays ice cold no matter how crazy a situation gets. These types of antagonists are the scariest of all as they can be all civilized and polite while planning to end you. Incredible performance of a really intriguing character. Oh, and did I mention that the actor is also a screenwriter, director and has 25 years of acting experience, at the mere age of 31? Kid’s got talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The payoff for whenever any bad guys get put in their place is definitely worth all the build up and feels very satisfying. If you are the type of person to enjoy these “sticking it to the man” stories then this drama is something for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The drama gets a lot better in the second half where the stakes are higher and the cases become increasingly personal and pressing for the main cast. No longer are complicated relationships in the past the point of conflict but rather current issues that affect the lives of near and dear characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There are too many flashbacks of the same scenes and events. They rarely add any new information and just indicate that the writer thinks their audience is too stupid to follow along the story. Too many unnecessary fake outs and reveals of plot information that was hidden away from the viewer, when said reveal is not even that impactful to the story. At other times, they have already shown us the result of an event and then show the flashback which takes all the suspense out of the flashback. This all boils down to decisions in editing that weren’t always the best. Speaking of the editing, the editing of the initial episodes of the drama makes the setup of it really hard to follow as they don’t introduce characters before putting them in important scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) There is not very good attention to detail throughout the drama. There are a surprising amount of continuity errors. It’s up to the set designer and editing to make sure that these don’t occur. I imagine that working on the sets and in the editing room of kdramas is very stressful so these kinds of errors are understandable. However, they still impact the overall quality of the drama. One example of this is when an office worker drops a stack of papers on the floor in one shot and in the next, said papers are several meters away. Also, I understand using CGI for small details such as a bug in a dirty kitchen is overkill, but you have to use better props than a plastic toy bought at a toy store. The only way you get away with having such cheap props is if you brush it off as a joke, but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The drama includes a pretty poor depiction of a suicide attempt. The scene is done in such a casual manner, almost making light of it with how non-dramatic it is.  I know there is a law against graphic depictions of the moment of suicide in Korean broadcasting regulations, but I feel like depictions of suicide need to be more dramatic than what they did in this drama. Of course, romanticizing suicide is not something a filmmaker should do either, but it certainly requires a serious execution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) One of the golden rules of storytelling is ”show don’t tell”, which I feel this show could have done better. The show rarely lets events speak for themselves and instead have the characters monologue afterwards about why said event is unethical. “Show don’t tell” is especially important in a satire based show where telling someone the message and the point over and over again can end up feeling preachy, instead of enlightening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Speaking of which, satire and comedy are almost entirely separated in this drama. Sure there are some good ironic jokes that are not in your face, like the corrupt “Clean Governor”, possibly being a comment on that people and governments who feel the need to call themselves clean and democratic usually are the most corrupt. Overall though, the satire is very serious throughout and the comedy is used for comic relief purposes in order to keep the drama from getting too dark and brooding. In my opinion, this style of satire is worse than a tongue-in-cheek satire as the writers can get away with less social criticism while being serious and can often come across as pushing an agenda or a message way too hard on its viewers. As the message is often constituted by platitudes as well, the satire becomes very watered down and safe, which is the opposite purpose of satire. You want it to be provoking, so that it can spawn a debate regarding the issues at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 6,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The premise and the subject matter are definitely really good and the drama builds to become a lot better towards the back half but the editing mistakes and choices along with the overtness of the comedy-less satire and the message it is trying to put forth makes the drama drop off in quality, at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Private Life - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romcom, slice of life drama about a painter who meets a curator by profession, fangirl by lifestyle, whereupon they fall in love at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The color grading in the drama is really visually pleasing, making each color pop. As there is so much focus on color and how it is assigned and associated with different characters, it fits perfectly here. How this is done is that you isolate a certain color and then you grade them individually in a digital program to create different effects. In combination with the set design often having quite neutral backgrounds it allows for certain colors to really stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The main leads have so many great scenes together thanks to good editing choices, acting and writing. The silence in intimate scenes is really effectful. It creates so much more tension than just blasting “romantic/emotional” music. It really gives the chemistry between the two leads room to shine and boy does it shine. Kim Jae Wook as Ryan Gold and Park Min Young as Sung Deok Mi both do a fantastic job at portraying a couple that is truly in love. Park Min Young is experienced in being the leading lady in romcoms and always puts up a good performance, whereas Kim Jae Wook really surprised with this being his first real romcom and yet he knocked it out of the park. The writing of the main characters really help as well since the couple is written to be reliant on each other but still keep their own autonomy. I really enjoy that they feel like equals in their relationship. Yes, Ryan is technically Deok Mi’s boss but it rarely feels like he uses his position to force Deok Mi things she wouldn’t otherwise do. They are both respectful towards each other and impossibly cute together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) “Her Private Life” reminds me a lot of shoujo manga/anime or a Jane Austen novel in its storytelling. A lot of the story is just looking into the mind of the main female protagonist and getting to know her emotions, her longing and her dreams. Much of the interesting parts of this character driven drama takes place in their minds and it is visualized very well through the scenes of the fantasy scenarios of different characters and what happens on the fan page Deok Mi runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some slice of life aspects to the show which means it has a quiet and slow type of story focusing on rather ordinary people. It&amp;#39;s not meant to be an epic love story or heartbreaking melodrama, and it doesn&amp;#39;t throw in a crime subplot just for the heck of it. Some might view this type of story as boring, I see it as endearing and charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Some of the product placement is really well done. The Canon cameras are among the most natural product placement I’ve seen in kdrama. Great choice of sponsor and they make the products essentially an accessory that fits in the story with both the fangirling aspect of the show as well as the photography/art side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the Canon product placement is done well, a lot of product placement in this drama is very in your face without any integration into the story or subtlety. I understand that unless the drama is a historical one, there will be product placement. However, there are creative and good ways to incorporate it into the drama, like they did with the Canon cameras. At times, the sponsorships of the drama are really aggravating and in your face which impacts the enjoyability of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Some of the characters outside of the main couple are shallowly written. The “brother” character Eun Gi has some really shallow writing and very few character traits. He likes judo and Deok Mi, that’s it. The actor Ahn Bohyun who plays Eun Gi is also a noticeably less experienced actor with this being one of his first main roles. This really shows in the scenes with the family when being on screen at the same time as Deok Mi’s parents played by Kim Mi Kyung and Maeng Sang Hoon, both of which are fantastic. There are other very shallowly written characters in the drama as well such as Da In. However, since she at least knows what she is doing to keep Ryan and Deok Mi from each other is wrong, as well as her being a supporting character, unlike Eun Gi, I am more forgiving about her character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The camera work frustrates me at times. In some of the intimate scenes between Deok Mi and Ryan they keep spinning the camera around the couple, breaking the 180 degree rule multiple times and making the viewer disoriented and almost dizzy. I get that they are trying to be dramatic about their kissing but I would liked it better if they toned it down just a bit in favor of better camera work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The last quarter of the drama really drops off in terms of writing. Who asked for a &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;prolonged childhood connection and backstory&lt;/span&gt; arc? Not me, that’s for sure. Since the drama is adapted from the novel “Noona fan dot com” (2007) and I haven’t read the novel, I’m not sure if this unnecessary part of the story is a byproduct of making a faithful adaptation or not. Nevertheless, there are a lot of other more interesting things they could have explored such as &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Ryan’s inability to paint and following his rehabilitation helped by Deok Mi, instead of just having him miraculously be able to paint again.&lt;/span&gt; Even if they were dead set on having &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the childhood backstory &lt;/span&gt;arc play out, they could have executed it way better as it currently requires a lot of suspension of disbelief and doesn’t add anything important to the characterization of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama is a really great romcom drama that unfortunately falls off a fair bit towards the last quarter of the show. On the whole, it is still a very enjoyable drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My First First Love (Season 1) - Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coming of age, slice of life, romance drama about a group of college aged friends who end up living together and experience love, friendship and life as young adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The first episode does a really excellent job of establishing the characters and the setting and keeping a good balance between exposition and hooking the viewer in. To start with, the cinematography really keeps up with the urgency of the story. The scenes flow into each other in a very natural way, which I think is a byproduct of not having commercial breaks. We are shown the different characters’ backgrounds and their variation in socioeconomic status and yet they all end up in the same place as they all have pretty good motivations for leaving home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) For the most part, I really like the cinematography. I enjoy how some shots linger after the characters go off-screen and then fades into a flashback from the same place is exquisite film making. Sure it’s been done before by why not borrow inspiration if it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the amount of extreme close ups they use to really emphasis the actions of characters in certain shots. It can be such ordinary things as opening a bag or twisting the accelerator on the scooter or something as moving as wiping someone’s tears away. It makes the drama feel more alive as there is more motion in the frame and allows for some sequences with fast cuts to add to the motion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama also makes good use of the basics of different angled shots. When the characters are down on their luck it shows us them from above looking down on them making us see them as vulnerable. When they are standing up for someone it shows us them from below looking up on the which makes them look powerful. It is also used in conversations when the angle switches depending on the mood of the current speaker when one character is sad and the other is happy, which is pretty clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The continuity control is pretty tight in this drama, well done to the script supervisor for making sure it is pretty free from any continuity errors. The level of drinks in non-opaque glasses tend to stay the same, a character who gets hit actually has marks from it later on and there are no major flubs with any props as far as I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The story is set up to turn out in two different ways in season 2, both of which would be quite interesting. As it is a remake of the 2015 drama ”Because this is the first time”, the writer could choose to keep the original ending from that drama which is a pretty unique ending in the context of kdramas. However, they could also decide to change the ending to be different than the original drama which I would see as surprising but still plausible. No matter which route they decided to go down, I will be happy either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) As it is a season 1, it ends on a cliffhanger and we will have to wait for the resolve until the release of season 2 which has its official release date set to July 26. They’ve had the entire drama filmed already and the reason for splitting it into two parts is probably to give time for post production to do their magic as well as build up hype for the ending of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) I wish they would chill with the lens flare and the super bright color grading. It’s like every time there is sun outside they feel the need to use lens flares and if the sun is coming in through a window, they use really bright filters in post production to drown the characters in light. This is clearly a stylistic choice and while I respect their choice, I don’t agree with it personally. It’s just not an aesthetic that I tend to be drawn towards as it creates less depth within a picture as the contours don’t show as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The roles that the main cast play aren’t the most challenging. Ji Soo is the one who shines the brightest but it feels like the role of Tae Oh is not letting him live up to his potential. The one role that required the most range was Jung Chaeyeon’s role as Song-i but I don’t feel like she delivered as well as I wished. For instance, Song-i’s most emotional and hard hitting scene is the bridge scene in episode 2. It’s good, but mainly thanks to the lines being really well written and the context of the scene rather than Chaeyeon’s performance being spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The character Se Hyon is just such a drag and we have to wait until next season until we find out why she is so unlikable to everyone around her. It’s a bit of a shame for the actress who plays her, Hong Ji Yoon, as she tends to be typecast to play vain and antagonistic characters. As it stands, her motivations are never made clear and she exists merely to be a pebble in Song-i’s shoe. I have a feeling her character might also have the purpose of teaching Tae Oh a valuable lesson about love. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In his desperate search for a girlfriend who is everything he dreamed of, he only finds pain and potentially even loses the girl he has always been truly in love with in order to seek a perfect love that doesn’t exist.&lt;/span&gt; However, this remains to be seen in the second season and until it is revealed what her character arc is like, her character feels like a bit of a hollow shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) As the show has a heavy romance focus, the characters who are not part of any romance get a bit shafted for story development and screen time despite being main characters. The characters Choi Hoon and especially Oh Ga Rin suffer from this and for a drama with an ensemble cast to work really well, all the characters in the ensemble have to get the chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a well shot drama with a quiet everyday story. It’s not fantastic and it does have its flaws but overall it does a good job of portraying young adult romance and friendships. I can imagine this drama being a good palate cleanser after watching something intense.&lt;/p&gt;

Her Private Life is my 9th K-Drama (yes I do count,I like to keep track of what I’m watching)But I just need to get this off my chest on what a great actor Kim Jae Wook is I’m not a fan, but I just admire his work as an artist.

First off - a bit of background. I’m a Scottish woman in my late twenties. I’m not new to watching foreign films or Asian media - I’ve been watching anime and reading manga/manhwa on and off for about ten years, through various stages of obsession. I read (and loved) Cheese in the Trap years ago but have not seen the drama yet. I also had a stage about three years ago of watching every Korean horror/thriller movie I could get my hands on. Some deeper background - as you can tell from what I just said, I cannot - CANNOT - enjoy things casually. If I like something, that thing takes over my life for a period of time until I feel like I know enough to be able to say I’m a fan. I feel like I’m finally coming down from the KDrama high I have been riding for the past 4 months, so I want to reflect a bit on how it’s affected me. 

1. I am planning to open up a bookshop this year, so when I saw ‘Romance is a Bonus Book’ on Netflix, I was slightly intrigued. I like romance, I like books, I liked the fact it was only 16 episodes. At this point, I knew very little about Korean drama. I’d tried to watch a Japanese drama set in a bookshop years ago and got about 2 episodes through it, so I was sort of expecting the same reaction to this show. WELL. I binged it in the space of a couple of days. At the time, it was one of the best things I’d seen. But now that I’ve watched a bunch of other dramas, it’s probably way down the list. The MDL rating I gave it immediately after watching it: 8.5. I’d probably give it about 7.5 or 8 now, but it holds a special place in my heart. 

2. Next up! ‘Strong Woman Do Bong Soon’. This was super cute. I thought it was hilarious. I was also used to the slapstick comedy of the gangsters because I’ve seen a few Korean films that have the same weird incongruity of dark themes with ridiculous humour where people hurt themselves in increasingly funny ways. The times where Bong Soon and Min Hyuk stop and stare at each other for like 2 minutes at a time was a bit ‘eh?’ to me, a person who is mostly used to British and American shows where kissing and sex happens all the time. I couldn’t get over the cuteness though, I felt like my heart was being literally squeezed at times. I kept rewatching the cute scenes. I’ve never done that with Western shows. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon made me realise that I now had a new obsession in the form of Korean (at this point, romance) drama. I felt like it was written for women in a way that most things aren’t, which made is seem incredibly accessible to me despite the fact that I’m probably not the targeted cultural audience. MDL rating I gave it immediately after watching: 9.5. Realistically, it could probably be lower, but these ratings are based purely on how I feel, and do not follow any kind of logical system, so you can pry the huge amount of love I have for this show out of my cold, dead hands.

3. ‘Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo’. Similar vibes to Bong Soon for me. Bad-ass female characters with love interests who find them super fucking adorable. I was quickly learning that this kind of dynamic is my absolute jam. SWAG. MDL Rating: 9.0.

4. Reply 1988. Holy. Crap. I cried non-stop for the last three episodes, and the episodes are damn long okay. After watching it, I did some research and realised most people were upset that &gt;!Deok-sun ended up with Taek instead of Jung-hwan. I was not upset, I thought Taek and Deok-sun had something special, but I also love Jung-hwan and yes I feel his ending could have improved but since they never explicitly stated what happened to him, I just assume he is living his best life and am all the happier for it.!&lt; I literally still watch certain scenes on YouTube of this show. The performance the guys did for Deok-sun’s talent show so she could win the tape player? Art. Any scene with Dong-ryong singing/dancing? Hilarious. I even loved all the scenes with the mums cutting vegetables and saying ‘aigoooo’ every ten seconds, that’s how I much I loved this drama. It was so beautiful. It was hilarious. MDL Rating: the first 10.

5. Suspicious Partner. The MDL rating I gave for this show after watching is was 8.0 but I feel like I was unfair because it had the crap luck to be watched straight after Reply 1988. Honestly, Ji Chang Wook is gorgeous, the kiss scenes were great, and I feel like it’s another show like Bong Soon that had that incongruity between serious/cutesy scenes. 

6. You Who Came From The Stars. Okay, so. The thing I remember the most about this show is the main dude kept having shower scenes where he was wearing a towel around his waist. It also seemed pretty cliche, but that obviously didn’t deter me because I would have killed for the two leads, and spent an inordinate amount crying over them. MDL Rating: 8.5

7. Reply 1994. I still missed Reply 1988. I was happy just to see Lee Il-hwa and Sung Dong-il being parents again. I did like it. But more likely because I like most things. I think if I stopped watching it half way through, I wouldn’t have felt the need to pick it back up again, but I was deep in my obsession at this point. MDL Rating: 8.5.

7. SIDE NOTE: At some point in between these shows I started watching Doctor Stranger and dropped it. I found the plot pretty ridiculous, almost like an American soap opera. Which is a shame because I found the bits in Pyongyang fascinating. 
8. Reply 1997. I am pretty sure I liked this better than Reply 1994, but for some reason I’ve also rated it 8.5. Maybe I liked it better in hindsight. Or maybe this is proof that my rating system really is a failure and should definitely be ignored. I really appreciated the chemistry between the two leads, but the same with the other two Reply series, it KINDA BOTHERS ME THAT THEY ARE IN LOVE AND THEN WAIT YEARS TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. But that doesn’t detract from all the other great things about them. Because of this show I ended up watching another Seo In-guk drama.

9. Shopping King Louie. (MDL: 9.5 - don’t judge me.) Again, I loved this, the romance was cute, it was kinda problematic… kinda really problematic, but I just didn’t take it seriously and enjoyed it for what it was. An opportunity to properly crush on Seo In-guk. Leading to…

10. The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. Jesus. First Melodrama. I wish I could have been warned about how much this would hurt!! I can’t believe it. Every other show I had watched until that point, everyone lived happily ever after, I wasn’t expecting this pain. Couldn’t stop thinking about it for days afterwards. MDL Rating: 8.5. 

11. Fight For My Way. Guys… GUYS. Park Seo Joon is literally everything in this drama. EVERYTHING. I loved this so damn much - the chemistry between the four main leads was insane. I felt like they’d literally been friends for years. I laughed so hard constantly in the first few episodes, then things started to hurt in the best way. Seol Hee was a bit of a scene stealer for me, I wanted her to be eternally happy. The relationship between Dong Man and Ae Ra was everything I want to see when I watch drama. I also liked that there were no chaebols, these characters were struggling in a very real way that other people in their 20s struggle. The only thing that was a bit off was the minor plot twist at the end with the landlady ahjumma, but I just forget it happened and don’t let it impact my feelings on the rest of the story. MDL Rating: 10.0

12. What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim? Did I like this show? Of course, it has Park Seo Joon in it. MDL Rating: 8.0

13. I’m Not A Robot. This was such a fresh concept, I liked this show a lot. Even though I really enjoyed it while watching it, I don’t really have much to say about it?? This was another one that surprisingly hit me hard in the feels. MDL Rating: 9.5. 

14. Because This Is My First Life. Ahhh, this was so gentle and lovely. A different kind of romance, but one that I feel needs it place beside the more dramatic love stories. Lee Min Ki is an incredible actor because I felt like I could understand his feelings even when he was being completely stone faced. Side note: MoonMoon’s song ‘Marriage’ from the OST is a beautiful song that sits with ‘Don’t Worry’ by Lee Juck from the Reply 1988 OST as two songs that I listen to on repeat on days when I’m feeling mopey. MDL Rating: 9.5

15. Healer. Ji Chang Wook, you gorgeous man. Also, Park Min Young - I get the hype now. I loved her character in this (a lot more than I liked her character in Secretary Kim). This was just good fun, despite all the hidden identities, casual stalking, fucked up family dynamics, etc. It was cute! I like seeing Ji Chang Wook dressed all in black beating up bad guys! A good time. MDL: 10.0

16. Another Miss Oh. I was so happy to see Ahjumma from Healer again. She made Hae Young’s mum a likeable character in a way that she might not have been if someone else played her? At least in the first few episodes. I liked that the main characters were very obviously flawed, and I liked the fact that Hae Young was not shy about her emotions. She was a bit crazy in a way we don’t see typical drama female leads being crazy. I rooted for them. It also felt like… I was watching a show with two secondary leads which was interesting. MDL: 9.0

17. Goblin. Oh my gosh. This beautiful drama. The production value was seriously so high, it was stunning. Before I watched it I thought it was going to be a very serious show at all times, but it was surprisingly freaking funny. I fell in love with everyone. I cried so hard. Grim Reaper and Goblin had such good chemistry. This show was intense, my love for it is intense. MDL: 10.0

18. Thirty But Seventeen. This was cute and kinda heartbreaking. Yang Se Jong is beautiful, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I’m a sucker for the found family trope. MDL: 9.0

19. Prison Playbook. I just finished this, and I think I need a break from other dramas for a few days to get my head around how much this show meant to me. This might potentially top Reply 1988. I felt personally invested in so many of the characters lives. It’s like Orange is the New Black but Korean and with men, and with a likeable main character instead. Lieutenant Paeng &lt;3 Jailbird &lt;3 Joon-ho&lt;3 Min-chul &lt;3 Jung-woo &lt;3 HANYANG &lt;3 This is the show I would recommend to people who have never seen a Korean drama before, as well as recommend it to people who have seen lots, as well as recommend you to rewatch it if you’ve seen it before. It was well-rounded perfection. I need time to recover from how amazing it was. 

Shows I have started that have been (lovingly) left behind and which I plan to pick back up at some point when I am in the right mood for them:

Love in the Moonlight. Park Bo Gum is a beautiful person, I honestly only have like 3 episodes of this show left, but I stopped watching it about two months ago and have yet to pick it up.

Eulachacha Waikiki. I have seen two episodes and laughed almost the whole way through but I guess I wasn’t in a comedy mood at the time.

The Guest. I love horror. This is a good horror show. I unfortunately started watching it when I was trying to stop watching so much romance but romance won in the end. I will pick this back up the next time I’m looking for something dark and miserable to watch.

Go Back Couple. Honestly, I don’t know why I stopped watching this, I need to pick it up again.

My First First Love. Started watching for Ji Soo. Not incredibly interested in it, but I only have about 3 episodes left to go. 

If writing all this out has proven anything, it’s that I have too many positive feelings, and would do well to dislike things more so that I can really truly differentiate between my favourite things and things I didn’t like as much. My rating system is a joke, so don’t come for me. One thing I’m sure of: all my tens deserve to be tens.

Other impacts that KDrama has had in my life: 

I read Human Acts by Han Kang, about the 80s uprisings in Korea and it’s a gorgeous and incredibly depressing book that I treasure but cannot recommend to most people because of how depressing and grim it is. 

I now do finger hearts but have to constantly explain what they are to people.

I have fallen into the blackhole with BTS and am genuinely scared to branch out into other Kpop in case I like other bands just as much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started watching Korean drama earlier this year and I wanted to write a little bit about my experience with it!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply 1997. I am pretty sure I liked this better than Reply 1994, but for some reason I’ve also rated it 8.5. Maybe I liked it better in hindsight. Or maybe this is proof that my rating system really is a failure and should definitely be ignored. I really appreciated the chemistry between the two leads, but the same with the other two Reply series, it KINDA BOTHERS ME THAT THEY ARE IN LOVE AND THEN WAIT YEARS TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. But that doesn’t detract from all the other great things about them. Because of this show I ended up watching another Seo In-guk drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shopping King Louie. (MDL: 9.5 - don’t judge me.) Again, I loved this, the romance was cute, it was kinda problematic… kinda really problematic, but I just didn’t take it seriously and enjoyed it for what it was. An opportunity to properly crush on Seo In-guk. Leading to…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. Jesus. First Melodrama. I wish I could have been warned about how much this would hurt!! I can’t believe it. Every other show I had watched until that point, everyone lived happily ever after, I wasn’t expecting this pain. Couldn’t stop thinking about it for days afterwards. MDL Rating: 8.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight For My Way. Guys… GUYS. Park Seo Joon is literally everything in this drama. EVERYTHING. I loved this so damn much - the chemistry between the four main leads was insane. I felt like they’d literally been friends for years. I laughed so hard constantly in the first few episodes, then things started to hurt in the best way. Seol Hee was a bit of a scene stealer for me, I wanted her to be eternally happy. The relationship between Dong Man and Ae Ra was everything I want to see when I watch drama. I also liked that there were no chaebols, these characters were struggling in a very real way that other people in their 20s struggle. The only thing that was a bit off was the minor plot twist at the end with the landlady ahjumma, but I just forget it happened and don’t let it impact my feelings on the rest of the story. MDL Rating: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim? Did I like this show? Of course, it has Park Seo Joon in it. MDL Rating: 8.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m Not A Robot. This was such a fresh concept, I liked this show a lot. Even though I really enjoyed it while watching it, I don’t really have much to say about it?? This was another one that surprisingly hit me hard in the feels. MDL Rating: 9.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because This Is My First Life. Ahhh, this was so gentle and lovely. A different kind of romance, but one that I feel needs it place beside the more dramatic love stories. Lee Min Ki is an incredible actor because I felt like I could understand his feelings even when he was being completely stone faced. Side note: MoonMoon’s song ‘Marriage’ from the OST is a beautiful song that sits with ‘Don’t Worry’ by Lee Juck from the Reply 1988 OST as two songs that I listen to on repeat on days when I’m feeling mopey. MDL Rating: 9.5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healer. Ji Chang Wook, you gorgeous man. Also, Park Min Young - I get the hype now. I loved her character in this (a lot more than I liked her character in Secretary Kim). This was just good fun, despite all the hidden identities, casual stalking, fucked up family dynamics, etc. It was cute! I like seeing Ji Chang Wook dressed all in black beating up bad guys! A good time. MDL: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Miss Oh. I was so happy to see Ahjumma from Healer again. She made Hae Young’s mum a likeable character in a way that she might not have been if someone else played her? At least in the first few episodes. I liked that the main characters were very obviously flawed, and I liked the fact that Hae Young was not shy about her emotions. She was a bit crazy in a way we don’t see typical drama female leads being crazy. I rooted for them. It also felt like… I was watching a show with two secondary leads which was interesting. MDL: 9.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goblin. Oh my gosh. This beautiful drama. The production value was seriously so high, it was stunning. Before I watched it I thought it was going to be a very serious show at all times, but it was surprisingly freaking funny. I fell in love with everyone. I cried so hard. Grim Reaper and Goblin had such good chemistry. This show was intense, my love for it is intense. MDL: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty But Seventeen. This was cute and kinda heartbreaking. Yang Se Jong is beautiful, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I’m a sucker for the found family trope. MDL: 9.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prison Playbook. I just finished this, and I think I need a break from other dramas for a few days to get my head around how much this show meant to me. This might potentially top Reply 1988. I felt personally invested in so many of the characters lives. It’s like Orange is the New Black but Korean and with men, and with a likeable main character instead. Lieutenant Paeng &amp;lt;3 Jailbird &amp;lt;3 Joon-ho&amp;lt;3 Min-chul &amp;lt;3 Jung-woo &amp;lt;3 HANYANG &amp;lt;3 This is the show I would recommend to people who have never seen a Korean drama before, as well as recommend it to people who have seen lots, as well as recommend you to rewatch it if you’ve seen it before. It was well-rounded perfection. I need time to recover from how amazing it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shows I have started that have been (lovingly) left behind and which I plan to pick back up at some point when I am in the right mood for them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love in the Moonlight. Park Bo Gum is a beautiful person, I honestly only have like 3 episodes of this show left, but I stopped watching it about two months ago and have yet to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eulachacha Waikiki. I have seen two episodes and laughed almost the whole way through but I guess I wasn’t in a comedy mood at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guest. I love horror. This is a good horror show. I unfortunately started watching it when I was trying to stop watching so much romance but romance won in the end. I will pick this back up the next time I’m looking for something dark and miserable to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go Back Couple. Honestly, I don’t know why I stopped watching this, I need to pick it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My First First Love. Started watching for Ji Soo. Not incredibly interested in it, but I only have about 3 episodes left to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If writing all this out has proven anything, it’s that I have too many positive feelings, and would do well to dislike things more so that I can really truly differentiate between my favourite things and things I didn’t like as much. My rating system is a joke, so don’t come for me. One thing I’m sure of: all my tens deserve to be tens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other impacts that KDrama has had in my life: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Human Acts by Han Kang, about the 80s uprisings in Korea and it’s a gorgeous and incredibly depressing book that I treasure but cannot recommend to most people because of how depressing and grim it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now do finger hearts but have to constantly explain what they are to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fallen into the blackhole with BTS and am genuinely scared to branch out into other Kpop in case I like other bands just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office""&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/a&gt; episodes 12 - 14 and vote for our next drama. &lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

Okay so you know what I think would make an AWESOME kdrama idea (obviously my mind is trying to think of anything else than waiting) 

 I think it would be cool if there was a drama where the secretary and ceo WERE really just awesome partners at work, and like, best friends because they work so well together, and each other’s confidant as they navigated their own individual romances - like the secretary could have a love hate relationship with a manager of a rival company, who she keeps going toe to toe with to protect HER ceo, and he could have a romance with like, some coffee shop worker or something who gets the wrong idea and thinks he’s a barista too 😂😂 and the roles could be reversed, female ceo and guy secretary, but I just really crave a healthy working partnership sometimes in these dramas and there’s a certain ick factor to me when the ceo falls for the girl who spends her life doing his bidding - and vice versa

So that’s my wish/rant, if anyone else is entertained! The closest I’ve seen is What Happens to my Family, with the original ceo (not the son).

As usual, let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**March**

&amp;#x200B;

**He Is Psychometric - TvN**

Sci-fi crime drama with elements of comedy and romance about a young man with the power to see past events just by touching objects or people.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) I really enjoy the recurring metaphor of a bird being tied down by chains inside of a cage and the notion that even if we want to leave we can’t as we are all tied down to something. In the case of the characters in this show, they are all tied down to the events of the past. &gt;!Seong Mo and his mother are still affected by the physical chains and abuse Seong Mo’s father put them through. Seong Mo’s father in return is still tied to the enslavement he experienced in his childhood. Ahn and Jae In had their lives altered by the apartment complex fire and to this day it is something that they can’t let go off. Ji Soo and her father are still tied to the father’s corrupt dealings in the past which restrict them.!&lt; There are other nice metaphors as well such as the trap, sail and anchor metaphor, but the bird in the cage was the one that really stuck with me.

(2) Although the main actors are young, they put in a good performance. Shin Yeeun, playing the role of the smart girl Yoon Jae In looking to fight crime, is actually a really good rookie actress. I’ve previously seen her in her breakout role in the hit webdrama “A-teen” (2018) where she was quite noticeably the brightest star. I was curious as to how she would transition into a full scale TV production and I think she managed just fine. Playing opposite her is Park Jinyoung who plays Lee Ahn, a boy with psychometric powers that allow him to see past events just by touching objects or people. This is Park Jinyoung’s second main role in a TV production, after having many support roles earlier on. Both of the main leads have big roles to play that are not easy by any stretch of the imagination. Jinyoung needs to play a playful goofball without overplaying and also display a ton of depth and trauma. Meanwhile, Yeeun needs to play a withdrawn and calculative police officer while not coming of as plain at the same time as she needs to display both sadness and a lust for revenge. Overall, I think they both managed this quite well.

(3) The fight scenes are few and far between but when they decide to throw one in it is well executed. There is one fight scene in particular that takes place in a narrow corridor that is really  nicely choreographed and well shot with two of the main leads fighting a bunch of henchmen. Obviously, it is not as sick as other iconic corridor fight scenes like in “Old Boy” (2003) or Netflix’s “Daredevil” (2015) but it is fairly well done and a quite memorable scene from the drama. The main difference maker is that those were both shot in one extended take whereas this is is more fine tuned and polished with many different shots, which takes away from the rawness of the scene.

(4) The establishment of characters and exposition is really smooth. It definitely uses “show don’t tell” in a textbook way. It tells us through the set design what the conflict in the Yeongsang apartment complex revolves around. Through the cinematography, it becomes clear to us that Ahn and Seong Mo have become brothers. We don’t need to see the whole process of them deciding to live together. Instead, that scene is shown to us later when it has more of an emotional impact. I also enjoy how  Ahn’s powers are established to be very underdeveloped to begin with due to him avoiding physical contact as much as he can. He doesn’t start out being this really powerful protagonist, instead we get to follow him on his hero’s journey.

(5) The show uses color grading to great effect. In case you didn’t know, color grading video is a digital technique that is done after filming and changes the color tone and mood of the film and was pioneered by the Oscar winner ”Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?” in the year 2000. In “He is Psychometric”’s flashback scenes, color grading is used to give everything a sort of yellow tint which gives of a nostalgic feeling, indicating visually that what you are watching took place in the past. In certain scenes, the color grading is really amped up to nine, only focusing on highlight a certain color or a certain object while leaving the rest of the shot monochromatic. Impactful imagery such as blood, fire or light is usually what is highlighted during these sequences of extreme color grading.

(6) The show uses dolly shots to creative effect. A dolly shot is executed by zooming in or out with the camera while moving the camera forwards or backwards on a track. The result is that the foreground stays in the same position while the background appears to squeeze or stretch. Usually this is done in relation to Ahn’s psychometry which gives us a sense that he is focused on what he is doing but at the same time emphasising to us how dizzy his powers make him.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The genre mix between romcom and crime thriller requires the viewer to enjoy both genres and how the drama executes them. Fortunately for me, I do enjoy both genres and think the drama executed both genres pretty well. I appreciate that they didn’t jump back and forth a whole lot between being comedic and dark instead there was a proper transition from leaning in a more light hearted direction to a more serious direction. However, I see why the genre mix would be off putting to viewers who just want to see a romcom or just want to see a crime drama.

(2) The twist is not surprising at all. Pretty early on, it becomes clear that there are only two people that would have motive to &gt;!fake the death of Prosecutor Seong Mo’s mom: Seong Mo and the mom. Once we learn about just how frail of a mental state the mother is in, it’s confirmed that the prosecutor was the one to fake his mother’s death by killing the women’s group and starting the apartment complex fire. From early on, it is also quite apparent from the editing where the camera lingers on Seong Mo then and cuts to menacing imagery that he is either a red herring or guilty in some way. The only question that remains afterwards is how involved he is in the murders and fires.!&lt;

(3) Some writing decisions felt like they were done purely to get a reaction out of the audience. For instance, &gt;!killing off Kim Da Som’s character, detective Eun Ji Soo, has little effect on the story. It doesn’t establish how violent the main antagonist is since we already know he is ruthless. The only thing that it really has an effect on is Ji Soo’s father deciding to out the corrupt actions of himself and the construction company.!&lt; Comparatively, there are other kdramas that have managed to &gt;!kill off main characters!&lt; to great effect where one &gt;!character’s death!&lt; has a massive impact on multiple facets of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,5 / 10* \- I enjoyed many aspects of the drama and with stronger writing it could have been a nine or higher.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Doctor Prisoner - KBS2**

Medical thriller drama about a doctor out to get revenge on those who made him lose his medical license.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The lighting in this drama in a bunch of scenes is 0% realism and 100% aesthetic, and I dig the hell out of that. Some scenes are just pure darkness that is drenched in yellow light and it looks so sick. Whether it be inside the prison or an interrogation room in the prosecutor's office, the heavily stylized lighting and color palette is featured which makes the drama stand out visually and really stick with you in your mind. It becomes a signature of the drama, through which you know they did a good job creating a unique art direction when it becomes so iconic and synonymous with the drama itself.

(2) The cast is ridiculously stacked with great actors and actresses. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you just picked out some of the actors from stellar dramas like Signal, Stranger, SKY Castle and the likes, then put them in the same drama. You get a show that is as well acted as Doctor Prisoner. The three men at the forefront, Nam Goong Min as the vindictive Dr. Na Yi Je, Choi Won Young as the power hungry CEO Lee Jae Joon and Kim Byung Chul as prison director Seon Min Sik, all put up ridiculously good performances. The ladies in the spotlight were no joke either, as Jin Hee Kyung, Lee Da In and even Nara, considering her lack of acting experience, did very well for themselves in their respective scenes.

(3) The plot is absolutely bonkers in the best way possible. There are about three plot twist per episode as the different characters try to mess with one another to outsmart or one up each other. There are not any established teams but instead the characters switch their allegiances when it suits their personal interest which I found both realistic and fascinating. In many cases, you are not quite sure whether you can fully trust a character, which is a good thing as it adds to the suspense. None of the characters are purely good or purely evil and there is always a reason behind why a character acts a certain way, which means that while you may hate a character because of their vile actions, you come to understand their motivations. While the different characters’ motivations are never muddled, they are not obvious to the point that the plot becomes predictable. The only thing you can really predict with one hundred percent accuracy is that the plot will remain unpredictable.

(4) It breaks the mold of the genre. I can confidently state that I usually don’t like medical dramas. However, I loved Doctor Prisoner since it strays away from the usual way a medical drama plays out. Firstly, the setting is not just a regular hospital as it takes place in a prison. Resources are scarce and the doctors have to make due with what they got in order to save their patients instead of relying on top-notch equipment. Since it takes place in a prison, there are also additional dangers as the patients and the people around them can be quite cumbersome. Just like the prisoners, the doctors also play by prison rules and occasionally throw ethics out of the window to further their own interest. Secondly, the conflict is seldom just “this patient has X symptoms, we have to solve it”, there are always additional layers behind how the patient came to be ill and why they absolutely need to be saved despite being criminals. There is always a main overarching conflict in the power struggle to hold power over a prison or a hospital or a company. Lastly, they managed to make a medical drama into more of a thriller instead of focusing largely on romance or melodrama like many medical dramas do, which is why I found it easier to digest and more unique.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) Some of the cast is underutilized, especially Nara’s character Han So Geum. A lot of the show’s focus is on the power struggle between the three gentlemen Na Yi Je, Lee Jae Joon and Seon Min Sik all looking to one up each other. As a result, even though Nara has a main role on the billing credits, she is pushed to the side quite a lot. Perhaps it is because she doesn’t quite have the same experience and resume that the other main actors have, in any case, she feels more like a supporting character. If one were to look at the drama from a gender perspective, it is a very male centered drama, which is unfortunate but fairly accurate considering the balance of genders in director and CEO positions in South Korea.

(2) The same thing applies to the comedy in this drama like what I wrote about the comedy in Kingdom. I personally don’t mind it, but I understand that if you are looking for a dark drama purely free from comedy, then the occasional comic relief would be a drawback. I felt like they went about the comedy bits in a tasteful way though and in my opinion, they added to the show more than they took away from it.

(3) The soundtrack isn’t all that. There is one main score that is played throughout the drama which is alright in itself but it becomes a bit repetitive. In suspenseful scenes, they always blast the sound of a heart rate monitor beeping loudly instead of an actual OST. The beeping ends up feeling overused towards the back half of the series as they use it at least once per episode.

(4) For once, I didn’t feel like the drama was too long but instead too short. The series was supposed to be extended for 2 episodes but ended up being reduced back to 32 episodes, which resulted in some questions being left unanswered by the plot. However, with the immense popularity of the drama in South Korea, a possible sequel is on the table, &gt;!especially considering the way the drama ended.!&lt; Perhaps some of the loose threads will be tied up then, but for now we are left wondering what happened to certain characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 9,5 / 10* \- The drama has enough small flaws not to warrant it a perfect score of ten out of ten, but it does come very close and it is surely a stand out drama of the year that you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching if you like a thrilling and tightly written story.

&amp;#x200B;

**Confession - TvN**

Legal crime drama about a lawyer seeking the truth behind a murder that resulted in his father ending up on death row.

Large thanks to r/KDRAMA ’s very own u/ordinaryguy92 for ripping and syncing the sub as this drama was never officially licensed.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The drama includes some really good courtroom scenes with solid logic behind the reasoning of the defense and the prosecution. Some of the social commentary is pretty solid as well, such as how corrupt people in power use celebrity scandals to control the media and distract the public from their own dirty deeds.

(2) The direction is on point. I wouldn’t expect any less coming from the director of Mother and Chicago Typewriter. Although the camera work is very intense with a lot of movement it manages it very well. Most of the time, the camera is slightly moving and zooming, creating urgency, fluidity and focus on whatever is currently important in the frame. Despite moving the camera a lot, there is rarely shaky cam (except for a few cases) or problems with blurry zooms or the focus being off. The camera movement is just really buttery which results in a very pleasant viewing experience. The drama also manages to use lens flare in a tasteful way that is not over the top with how in your face lens flare can be used for artistic effect.

(3) The writer Im Hee Cheol is pretty new to the scene but did an excellent job, proving that although experience is important, it is not everything. The story takes some twist and turns and it is not always obvious what is going to happen although yet the story progresses very naturally. It should be said though that some plot points are very obviously foreshadowed so if you are well versed in film and literature they should come as no surprise to you. One example of this is &gt;!the fact that Choi ’s father took the blame for killing the warrant officer in order to get his son a heart transplant which ended up with father being murdered. This is quite apparent already in episode 5 but they make it a big reveal of it in episode 11 and confirm it in episode 14. As a viewer you’re just left like: ”yes, we been knew for a while now”.!&lt;

(4) There are some great fake outs in this drama where something is introduced and thanks to the editing you think it will benefit or damage the protagonist but it turns out to do the opposite, resulting in some great reversals of expectations. One such occurrence is when it seems like a device is recording the protagonists conversation and it will end up hurting them but as it turns out that device was actually planted there by someone with the same goal as our heroes and it turns out the device contains important evidence.

(5) Lee Junho is pretty good at acting, the stereotype of ”idol actor” definitely does not apply to him. Although his character is quite reserved in this drama, he manages to avoid falling in to the trap of appearing to be wooden. You can tell on his face that there are plenty of emotions flowing within the character despite the calm and collected facade that would indicate otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama requires some suspension of disbelief. Some of the time aspects seem a bit off in order to make the story more interesting. A person of interest always arrive in court at the very last second and investigations are started late in order for them to finish right before the trial. Additionally as with all crime series, you have police officers, prosecutor and even crime scene investigators not wearing proper equipment for examining a crime scene and touching things in a crime scene with their bare hands. Once again, it ruins the immersion but it is something that you can look past once you suspend your disbelief.

(2) Although the camera movement is mostly really smooth, I wish they would have used more fixed shots for some scenes where constantly moving the camera adds little to nothing to the scene. It’s fine if you’re not actively thinking about it, but once you start analyzing the series shot by shot, it becomes slightly annoying. Additionally, the handheld shaky cam used in for instance chase scenes is such a stark contrast to the otherwise really smooth camera work.

(3) The sound mixing is a little uneven at points which makes it clear that some of the dubbed dialogue was recorded at different occasions as the sound level and quality varies between takes. For the uninitiated, the reason for dubbing over a scene while still using the original actors voice could be that the scene is recorded in a location that does not allow for good quality audio recordings due to for instance echo or strong wind.

(4) I’m not a big fan of the dramatic “sting” sound effect that they add whenever they need to up up the tension. It has become dime a dozen in almost every movie trailer these days but the usage of it especially in the actually series feels rather lazy and uninspired. The drama is exciting enough as it is, it doesn’t need this stinger sound whenever something important is revealed. Sure, these types of sound effects where fresh when used in movies that popularized them such as Transformers (2006) and Inception (2010), but around ten years later they’ve grown stale.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,5 / 10* \- I really enjoy the story but some of the production choices and misses really hinders my score from being any higher.

**Kill It - OCN**

Action thriller drama about a professional assassin trying to find out about his mysterious past.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The actors were well cast for their roles. Nana does a good job at portraying detective Do Hyun Jin despite not having many dramas on her resume previously. Jang Ki Yong is perfect for the role of an emotionless assassin such as the character of Kim Soo Hyun he plays here. Noh Jung Eui is great as the orphan Kang Seulgi considering she is only 17 years old, much thanks to her already extensive list of dramas that she has acted in during the last 8 years. Lee Jae Won is also a great fit as the mischievous hacker Phillip Ahn.

(2) The actors also had some pretty good chemistry with each other. Even though there is no romance in this drama, the tension between Hyun Jin and Soo Hyun is palpable and it feels like you can cut the atmosphere with a knife. Soo Hyun and Seulgi have a interesting relationship much like that of an older brother and a younger sister despite not being related. They take care of each other in different ways and bicker with one another just like siblings do. Hyun Jin and Seulgi have a somewhat love-hate relationship to one another as they start out as enemies but after a while they grow on each other. Soo Hyun and Phillip have some bromance and banter amongst each other in one scene and are at each others neck in the next one.

(3) “Kill It” has parallels to one of my favorite novels of the 21st century, in that one of the themes and plot line is quite similar. &gt;!The novel in question is “Never Let Me Go” (2005) from the Nobel prize winning author Kazuo Ishiguro. “Never Let Me Go” touches upon the use of cloning humans in order to harvest their organs. Although “Kill It” doesn’t have any cloning but it does focus on the ethics of using test tube children for the same purpose. Much like in “Never Let Me Go”, the children that are to be harvested for their organs are kept in an institution far away from the rest of civilization. Both of the stories deals with organ harvesting, medical ethics and research ethics and asks questions about the human condition like what is the worth of a human being and whether some people have an inherently higher worth than others.!&lt; I really enjoy this aspect of the drama.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The art direction and color palette of the drama is a huge let down. You know that really cool color palette of black, neon blue and neon pink that was on the poster for the show? Yea, that shows up in exactly one scene. A lot of the drama is just slathered in grey and brown going for the most generic art direction for a serious crime thriller.

(2) Probably the biggest issue is the writing of the show.  This is probably due to the screenwriters Choi Myung Jin and Son Hyun Soo being brand new to writing a drama, so one can understand why the series has its writing flaws as new writers usually need time to get really good.  Up until around the halfway mark of the story it isn’t too bad. However, after that is were it really starts to come apart in the seams. After half of the drama has passed too much information has already been relayed and the audience has already had almost everything revealed to them. They unraveled the plot in 6 episodes and after that we are left just watching the characters learn what we’ve already been clued in on.

(3) Characters are introduced to have traits that are never used for anything useful. Hyun Jin is shown to be excellent at throwing darts but never uses this skill for anything other than shutting up snarky colleagues. The characters are not strongly enough written to have many different facets to them and many of the characters outside of the main cast are very one-dimensional. As a result the characters do not drive the drama forward either when the plot is stalling. None of the characters go through major character development but stay rather static during the drama, with Seulgi being the only character to grow noticeably in the drama.

(4) The alternative title for this show is Blue Eyes, indicating that they are an important part to the story. Throughout the first episode, the editing also puts a lot of emphasis on the blue eyes, making the viewer think it will lead to something integral to the story. The only real tie-in to it during the rest of the show is that we briefly learn that the blue eyes are a &gt;!side effect of the artificial insemination and the test tube babies being developed in a lab.!&lt; This leaves us with the pressing question of what happened to Soo Hyun’s blue eyes, as he had them when he was around 10 and he doesn’t have them at adult age. This is never answered in the show despite putting a lot of focus on the blue eyes.

(5) The dialogue is a bit lacking and it has the typical kdrama issue of having many interactions being expressed purely through stares. It’s not quite at “Twilight” (2008) level of staring but there is still too much staring and too little dialogue for my liking. Especially since some of the dialogue is pretty decent, primarily the banter between the main characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 5,5 / 10* \- The concept was really cool, the casting was good and it touches on some interesting topics but the weak writing in regards to the plot and the characters in combination with a mostly uninspired art direction makes for a slightly below average drama.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Eulachacha Waikiki 2 - JTBC**

Sitcom drama about a group of friends living at a guest house who keep finding themselves caught up in wacky scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) It is quite unique in the sense that it is one of the only prime time sitcoms to air in the last couple of years. Yes, there are other comedy shows but very few use the sitcom format, which makes it stand out of the crowd in the kdrama landscape. As it is a sitcom, much of the comedy comes from the situations that the characters find themselves in. Many situations are also created by the characters through their lying and how the lying just keeps escalating is executed really well. Instead of causing frustrating misunderstandings it leads to ridiculously funny scenes.

(2) They use really cheesy effects in a good way, making them intentionally funny. For instance they use the classic comic book effect of a spark in the sky to indicate a home run. This shot isn’t meant to look good or realistic, it’s meant to be funny and it manages that well.

(3) They use contrastive humor really well. For instance when there is chaos in a scene and they make it into a montage and put cheery music over it. What adds to the hilariousness is that the main cast are all really good at body gags. Through just their facial expressions and bodies they convey comedy that is truly universal and crosses language barriers.

(4) The show integrates aspects that are staples of Korean variety shows. It is not the first drama to do this but it never fails to be funny. Examples includes such classics as blasting Careless Whisper by George Michael when something is implied to be erotic, or Mai Piu by Andrea Bocelli when someone is expecting something romantic, or She Is by Clazziquai Project when there is some implied guy-on-guy action.

(5) The referential humor is on point, when they referenced The Face Reader, I was rolling with laughter. Game of Thrones soundtrack when determining who will take the throne of being the most handsome. Something in the Rain soundtrack plays everytime there is hints of noona romance, that actually isn’t that romantic. There are so many other references in the drama as well, some of which include: Harry Potter, The Guest, SKY Castle, Suicide Squad, Forrest Gump, The X-Files, Kill Bill, Love Actually, and Kimi No Nawa.

(6) The show also manages to deliver some really heartfelt and touching moments in between all the silly wackiness. All of the main cast get to show of their weaknesses, their dreams and their aspirations which makes the viewer really connect with them. It gives the show a lot of heart and makes the joke really count.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) This show is riddled with plot holes and the story is definitely something that comes second whereas the comedy comes first. The natural progression of a story is thrown out of the window for the sake of comedy. While there is nothing inherently wrong with that, it would be more impressive if they could balance the two aspects at the same time.

(2) The comedy by repetition can be pretty funny, but at the same time it can also get really stale when they just spend too much time repeating the same joke over and over again. If you find the joke funny to begin with, it’s probably gonna get even funnier, but if you didn’t enjoy it, you’ll wish they just stopped.

(3) That one suicide joke in episode 14 just didn’t sit right with me. It felt so unnecessary. Considering the very high youth suicide rates in South Korea, I just cannot fathom why the writers would think this was a good idea. There is nothing wrong with dark comedy but when it comes out of left field in an otherwise lighthearted series it just feels out of place and unjustified.

(4) Due to its sitcom nature, the story lacks continuity. Unlike in season 1 where there is the baby left at the Waikiki guesthouse acting as an overarching plot thread that ties everything together, there is a lack of such a thing in season 2. That results in the story line not coming together in the same way. One possibility that they could have utilized was to put the missing father of the character Han Soo Yeon more at the center of the story to act like a similar plot device to the baby in season 1. Another way in which the story lacks continuity is through characters coming in and out of the story so frequently even when they should realistically be present more often. One such character is the landlord of the guesthouse who just disappears after the first few episodes. The guesthouse is also quite inconsistent since at times it feels like an actual guesthouse where there are actual guests living while at other times it just feels like our main casts dorm or collective living where they lounge about however they please without anyone else coming in or out.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,5 / 10* \- It is a perfect pick-me-up drama to watch whenever you are feeling like watching something fun but don’t go in expecting a mind blowing story. The comedy mostly hits the mark and it is occasionally quite touching. My single biggest wish would be that the story was more coherent, which would significantly improve the quality of the story writing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Psychometric - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-fi crime drama with elements of comedy and romance about a young man with the power to see past events just by touching objects or people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) I really enjoy the recurring metaphor of a bird being tied down by chains inside of a cage and the notion that even if we want to leave we can’t as we are all tied down to something. In the case of the characters in this show, they are all tied down to the events of the past. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Seong Mo and his mother are still affected by the physical chains and abuse Seong Mo’s father put them through. Seong Mo’s father in return is still tied to the enslavement he experienced in his childhood. Ahn and Jae In had their lives altered by the apartment complex fire and to this day it is something that they can’t let go off. Ji Soo and her father are still tied to the father’s corrupt dealings in the past which restrict them.&lt;/span&gt; There are other nice metaphors as well such as the trap, sail and anchor metaphor, but the bird in the cage was the one that really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Although the main actors are young, they put in a good performance. Shin Yeeun, playing the role of the smart girl Yoon Jae In looking to fight crime, is actually a really good rookie actress. I’ve previously seen her in her breakout role in the hit webdrama “A-teen” (2018) where she was quite noticeably the brightest star. I was curious as to how she would transition into a full scale TV production and I think she managed just fine. Playing opposite her is Park Jinyoung who plays Lee Ahn, a boy with psychometric powers that allow him to see past events just by touching objects or people. This is Park Jinyoung’s second main role in a TV production, after having many support roles earlier on. Both of the main leads have big roles to play that are not easy by any stretch of the imagination. Jinyoung needs to play a playful goofball without overplaying and also display a ton of depth and trauma. Meanwhile, Yeeun needs to play a withdrawn and calculative police officer while not coming of as plain at the same time as she needs to display both sadness and a lust for revenge. Overall, I think they both managed this quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The fight scenes are few and far between but when they decide to throw one in it is well executed. There is one fight scene in particular that takes place in a narrow corridor that is really  nicely choreographed and well shot with two of the main leads fighting a bunch of henchmen. Obviously, it is not as sick as other iconic corridor fight scenes like in “Old Boy” (2003) or Netflix’s “Daredevil” (2015) but it is fairly well done and a quite memorable scene from the drama. The main difference maker is that those were both shot in one extended take whereas this is is more fine tuned and polished with many different shots, which takes away from the rawness of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The establishment of characters and exposition is really smooth. It definitely uses “show don’t tell” in a textbook way. It tells us through the set design what the conflict in the Yeongsang apartment complex revolves around. Through the cinematography, it becomes clear to us that Ahn and Seong Mo have become brothers. We don’t need to see the whole process of them deciding to live together. Instead, that scene is shown to us later when it has more of an emotional impact. I also enjoy how  Ahn’s powers are established to be very underdeveloped to begin with due to him avoiding physical contact as much as he can. He doesn’t start out being this really powerful protagonist, instead we get to follow him on his hero’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The show uses color grading to great effect. In case you didn’t know, color grading video is a digital technique that is done after filming and changes the color tone and mood of the film and was pioneered by the Oscar winner ”Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?” in the year 2000. In “He is Psychometric”’s flashback scenes, color grading is used to give everything a sort of yellow tint which gives of a nostalgic feeling, indicating visually that what you are watching took place in the past. In certain scenes, the color grading is really amped up to nine, only focusing on highlight a certain color or a certain object while leaving the rest of the shot monochromatic. Impactful imagery such as blood, fire or light is usually what is highlighted during these sequences of extreme color grading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The show uses dolly shots to creative effect. A dolly shot is executed by zooming in or out with the camera while moving the camera forwards or backwards on a track. The result is that the foreground stays in the same position while the background appears to squeeze or stretch. Usually this is done in relation to Ahn’s psychometry which gives us a sense that he is focused on what he is doing but at the same time emphasising to us how dizzy his powers make him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The genre mix between romcom and crime thriller requires the viewer to enjoy both genres and how the drama executes them. Fortunately for me, I do enjoy both genres and think the drama executed both genres pretty well. I appreciate that they didn’t jump back and forth a whole lot between being comedic and dark instead there was a proper transition from leaning in a more light hearted direction to a more serious direction. However, I see why the genre mix would be off putting to viewers who just want to see a romcom or just want to see a crime drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The twist is not surprising at all. Pretty early on, it becomes clear that there are only two people that would have motive to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;fake the death of Prosecutor Seong Mo’s mom: Seong Mo and the mom. Once we learn about just how frail of a mental state the mother is in, it’s confirmed that the prosecutor was the one to fake his mother’s death by killing the women’s group and starting the apartment complex fire. From early on, it is also quite apparent from the editing where the camera lingers on Seong Mo then and cuts to menacing imagery that he is either a red herring or guilty in some way. The only question that remains afterwards is how involved he is in the murders and fires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some writing decisions felt like they were done purely to get a reaction out of the audience. For instance, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;killing off Kim Da Som’s character, detective Eun Ji Soo, has little effect on the story. It doesn’t establish how violent the main antagonist is since we already know he is ruthless. The only thing that it really has an effect on is Ji Soo’s father deciding to out the corrupt actions of himself and the construction company.&lt;/span&gt; Comparatively, there are other kdramas that have managed to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;kill off main characters&lt;/span&gt; to great effect where one &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;character’s death&lt;/span&gt; has a massive impact on multiple facets of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - I enjoyed many aspects of the drama and with stronger writing it could have been a nine or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Prisoner - KBS2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical thriller drama about a doctor out to get revenge on those who made him lose his medical license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The lighting in this drama in a bunch of scenes is 0% realism and 100% aesthetic, and I dig the hell out of that. Some scenes are just pure darkness that is drenched in yellow light and it looks so sick. Whether it be inside the prison or an interrogation room in the prosecutor&amp;#39;s office, the heavily stylized lighting and color palette is featured which makes the drama stand out visually and really stick with you in your mind. It becomes a signature of the drama, through which you know they did a good job creating a unique art direction when it becomes so iconic and synonymous with the drama itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The cast is ridiculously stacked with great actors and actresses. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you just picked out some of the actors from stellar dramas like Signal, Stranger, SKY Castle and the likes, then put them in the same drama. You get a show that is as well acted as Doctor Prisoner. The three men at the forefront, Nam Goong Min as the vindictive Dr. Na Yi Je, Choi Won Young as the power hungry CEO Lee Jae Joon and Kim Byung Chul as prison director Seon Min Sik, all put up ridiculously good performances. The ladies in the spotlight were no joke either, as Jin Hee Kyung, Lee Da In and even Nara, considering her lack of acting experience, did very well for themselves in their respective scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The plot is absolutely bonkers in the best way possible. There are about three plot twist per episode as the different characters try to mess with one another to outsmart or one up each other. There are not any established teams but instead the characters switch their allegiances when it suits their personal interest which I found both realistic and fascinating. In many cases, you are not quite sure whether you can fully trust a character, which is a good thing as it adds to the suspense. None of the characters are purely good or purely evil and there is always a reason behind why a character acts a certain way, which means that while you may hate a character because of their vile actions, you come to understand their motivations. While the different characters’ motivations are never muddled, they are not obvious to the point that the plot becomes predictable. The only thing you can really predict with one hundred percent accuracy is that the plot will remain unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) It breaks the mold of the genre. I can confidently state that I usually don’t like medical dramas. However, I loved Doctor Prisoner since it strays away from the usual way a medical drama plays out. Firstly, the setting is not just a regular hospital as it takes place in a prison. Resources are scarce and the doctors have to make due with what they got in order to save their patients instead of relying on top-notch equipment. Since it takes place in a prison, there are also additional dangers as the patients and the people around them can be quite cumbersome. Just like the prisoners, the doctors also play by prison rules and occasionally throw ethics out of the window to further their own interest. Secondly, the conflict is seldom just “this patient has X symptoms, we have to solve it”, there are always additional layers behind how the patient came to be ill and why they absolutely need to be saved despite being criminals. There is always a main overarching conflict in the power struggle to hold power over a prison or a hospital or a company. Lastly, they managed to make a medical drama into more of a thriller instead of focusing largely on romance or melodrama like many medical dramas do, which is why I found it easier to digest and more unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Some of the cast is underutilized, especially Nara’s character Han So Geum. A lot of the show’s focus is on the power struggle between the three gentlemen Na Yi Je, Lee Jae Joon and Seon Min Sik all looking to one up each other. As a result, even though Nara has a main role on the billing credits, she is pushed to the side quite a lot. Perhaps it is because she doesn’t quite have the same experience and resume that the other main actors have, in any case, she feels more like a supporting character. If one were to look at the drama from a gender perspective, it is a very male centered drama, which is unfortunate but fairly accurate considering the balance of genders in director and CEO positions in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The same thing applies to the comedy in this drama like what I wrote about the comedy in Kingdom. I personally don’t mind it, but I understand that if you are looking for a dark drama purely free from comedy, then the occasional comic relief would be a drawback. I felt like they went about the comedy bits in a tasteful way though and in my opinion, they added to the show more than they took away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The soundtrack isn’t all that. There is one main score that is played throughout the drama which is alright in itself but it becomes a bit repetitive. In suspenseful scenes, they always blast the sound of a heart rate monitor beeping loudly instead of an actual OST. The beeping ends up feeling overused towards the back half of the series as they use it at least once per episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) For once, I didn’t feel like the drama was too long but instead too short. The series was supposed to be extended for 2 episodes but ended up being reduced back to 32 episodes, which resulted in some questions being left unanswered by the plot. However, with the immense popularity of the drama in South Korea, a possible sequel is on the table, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;especially considering the way the drama ended.&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps some of the loose threads will be tied up then, but for now we are left wondering what happened to certain characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 9,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The drama has enough small flaws not to warrant it a perfect score of ten out of ten, but it does come very close and it is surely a stand out drama of the year that you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching if you like a thrilling and tightly written story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confession - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal crime drama about a lawyer seeking the truth behind a murder that resulted in his father ending up on death row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large thanks to &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; ’s very own &lt;a href=""/u/ordinaryguy92""&gt;u/ordinaryguy92&lt;/a&gt; for ripping and syncing the sub as this drama was never officially licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama includes some really good courtroom scenes with solid logic behind the reasoning of the defense and the prosecution. Some of the social commentary is pretty solid as well, such as how corrupt people in power use celebrity scandals to control the media and distract the public from their own dirty deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The direction is on point. I wouldn’t expect any less coming from the director of Mother and Chicago Typewriter. Although the camera work is very intense with a lot of movement it manages it very well. Most of the time, the camera is slightly moving and zooming, creating urgency, fluidity and focus on whatever is currently important in the frame. Despite moving the camera a lot, there is rarely shaky cam (except for a few cases) or problems with blurry zooms or the focus being off. The camera movement is just really buttery which results in a very pleasant viewing experience. The drama also manages to use lens flare in a tasteful way that is not over the top with how in your face lens flare can be used for artistic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The writer Im Hee Cheol is pretty new to the scene but did an excellent job, proving that although experience is important, it is not everything. The story takes some twist and turns and it is not always obvious what is going to happen although yet the story progresses very naturally. It should be said though that some plot points are very obviously foreshadowed so if you are well versed in film and literature they should come as no surprise to you. One example of this is &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the fact that Choi ’s father took the blame for killing the warrant officer in order to get his son a heart transplant which ended up with father being murdered. This is quite apparent already in episode 5 but they make it a big reveal of it in episode 11 and confirm it in episode 14. As a viewer you’re just left like: ”yes, we been knew for a while now”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some great fake outs in this drama where something is introduced and thanks to the editing you think it will benefit or damage the protagonist but it turns out to do the opposite, resulting in some great reversals of expectations. One such occurrence is when it seems like a device is recording the protagonists conversation and it will end up hurting them but as it turns out that device was actually planted there by someone with the same goal as our heroes and it turns out the device contains important evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Lee Junho is pretty good at acting, the stereotype of ”idol actor” definitely does not apply to him. Although his character is quite reserved in this drama, he manages to avoid falling in to the trap of appearing to be wooden. You can tell on his face that there are plenty of emotions flowing within the character despite the calm and collected facade that would indicate otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama requires some suspension of disbelief. Some of the time aspects seem a bit off in order to make the story more interesting. A person of interest always arrive in court at the very last second and investigations are started late in order for them to finish right before the trial. Additionally as with all crime series, you have police officers, prosecutor and even crime scene investigators not wearing proper equipment for examining a crime scene and touching things in a crime scene with their bare hands. Once again, it ruins the immersion but it is something that you can look past once you suspend your disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Although the camera movement is mostly really smooth, I wish they would have used more fixed shots for some scenes where constantly moving the camera adds little to nothing to the scene. It’s fine if you’re not actively thinking about it, but once you start analyzing the series shot by shot, it becomes slightly annoying. Additionally, the handheld shaky cam used in for instance chase scenes is such a stark contrast to the otherwise really smooth camera work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The sound mixing is a little uneven at points which makes it clear that some of the dubbed dialogue was recorded at different occasions as the sound level and quality varies between takes. For the uninitiated, the reason for dubbing over a scene while still using the original actors voice could be that the scene is recorded in a location that does not allow for good quality audio recordings due to for instance echo or strong wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) I’m not a big fan of the dramatic “sting” sound effect that they add whenever they need to up up the tension. It has become dime a dozen in almost every movie trailer these days but the usage of it especially in the actually series feels rather lazy and uninspired. The drama is exciting enough as it is, it doesn’t need this stinger sound whenever something important is revealed. Sure, these types of sound effects where fresh when used in movies that popularized them such as Transformers (2006) and Inception (2010), but around ten years later they’ve grown stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - I really enjoy the story but some of the production choices and misses really hinders my score from being any higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill It - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action thriller drama about a professional assassin trying to find out about his mysterious past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The actors were well cast for their roles. Nana does a good job at portraying detective Do Hyun Jin despite not having many dramas on her resume previously. Jang Ki Yong is perfect for the role of an emotionless assassin such as the character of Kim Soo Hyun he plays here. Noh Jung Eui is great as the orphan Kang Seulgi considering she is only 17 years old, much thanks to her already extensive list of dramas that she has acted in during the last 8 years. Lee Jae Won is also a great fit as the mischievous hacker Phillip Ahn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The actors also had some pretty good chemistry with each other. Even though there is no romance in this drama, the tension between Hyun Jin and Soo Hyun is palpable and it feels like you can cut the atmosphere with a knife. Soo Hyun and Seulgi have a interesting relationship much like that of an older brother and a younger sister despite not being related. They take care of each other in different ways and bicker with one another just like siblings do. Hyun Jin and Seulgi have a somewhat love-hate relationship to one another as they start out as enemies but after a while they grow on each other. Soo Hyun and Phillip have some bromance and banter amongst each other in one scene and are at each others neck in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) “Kill It” has parallels to one of my favorite novels of the 21st century, in that one of the themes and plot line is quite similar. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The novel in question is “Never Let Me Go” (2005) from the Nobel prize winning author Kazuo Ishiguro. “Never Let Me Go” touches upon the use of cloning humans in order to harvest their organs. Although “Kill It” doesn’t have any cloning but it does focus on the ethics of using test tube children for the same purpose. Much like in “Never Let Me Go”, the children that are to be harvested for their organs are kept in an institution far away from the rest of civilization. Both of the stories deals with organ harvesting, medical ethics and research ethics and asks questions about the human condition like what is the worth of a human being and whether some people have an inherently higher worth than others.&lt;/span&gt; I really enjoy this aspect of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The art direction and color palette of the drama is a huge let down. You know that really cool color palette of black, neon blue and neon pink that was on the poster for the show? Yea, that shows up in exactly one scene. A lot of the drama is just slathered in grey and brown going for the most generic art direction for a serious crime thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Probably the biggest issue is the writing of the show.  This is probably due to the screenwriters Choi Myung Jin and Son Hyun Soo being brand new to writing a drama, so one can understand why the series has its writing flaws as new writers usually need time to get really good.  Up until around the halfway mark of the story it isn’t too bad. However, after that is were it really starts to come apart in the seams. After half of the drama has passed too much information has already been relayed and the audience has already had almost everything revealed to them. They unraveled the plot in 6 episodes and after that we are left just watching the characters learn what we’ve already been clued in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Characters are introduced to have traits that are never used for anything useful. Hyun Jin is shown to be excellent at throwing darts but never uses this skill for anything other than shutting up snarky colleagues. The characters are not strongly enough written to have many different facets to them and many of the characters outside of the main cast are very one-dimensional. As a result the characters do not drive the drama forward either when the plot is stalling. None of the characters go through major character development but stay rather static during the drama, with Seulgi being the only character to grow noticeably in the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The alternative title for this show is Blue Eyes, indicating that they are an important part to the story. Throughout the first episode, the editing also puts a lot of emphasis on the blue eyes, making the viewer think it will lead to something integral to the story. The only real tie-in to it during the rest of the show is that we briefly learn that the blue eyes are a &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;side effect of the artificial insemination and the test tube babies being developed in a lab.&lt;/span&gt; This leaves us with the pressing question of what happened to Soo Hyun’s blue eyes, as he had them when he was around 10 and he doesn’t have them at adult age. This is never answered in the show despite putting a lot of focus on the blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The dialogue is a bit lacking and it has the typical kdrama issue of having many interactions being expressed purely through stares. It’s not quite at “Twilight” (2008) level of staring but there is still too much staring and too little dialogue for my liking. Especially since some of the dialogue is pretty decent, primarily the banter between the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 5,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The concept was really cool, the casting was good and it touches on some interesting topics but the weak writing in regards to the plot and the characters in combination with a mostly uninspired art direction makes for a slightly below average drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eulachacha Waikiki 2 - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitcom drama about a group of friends living at a guest house who keep finding themselves caught up in wacky scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) It is quite unique in the sense that it is one of the only prime time sitcoms to air in the last couple of years. Yes, there are other comedy shows but very few use the sitcom format, which makes it stand out of the crowd in the kdrama landscape. As it is a sitcom, much of the comedy comes from the situations that the characters find themselves in. Many situations are also created by the characters through their lying and how the lying just keeps escalating is executed really well. Instead of causing frustrating misunderstandings it leads to ridiculously funny scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) They use really cheesy effects in a good way, making them intentionally funny. For instance they use the classic comic book effect of a spark in the sky to indicate a home run. This shot isn’t meant to look good or realistic, it’s meant to be funny and it manages that well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) They use contrastive humor really well. For instance when there is chaos in a scene and they make it into a montage and put cheery music over it. What adds to the hilariousness is that the main cast are all really good at body gags. Through just their facial expressions and bodies they convey comedy that is truly universal and crosses language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The show integrates aspects that are staples of Korean variety shows. It is not the first drama to do this but it never fails to be funny. Examples includes such classics as blasting Careless Whisper by George Michael when something is implied to be erotic, or Mai Piu by Andrea Bocelli when someone is expecting something romantic, or She Is by Clazziquai Project when there is some implied guy-on-guy action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The referential humor is on point, when they referenced The Face Reader, I was rolling with laughter. Game of Thrones soundtrack when determining who will take the throne of being the most handsome. Something in the Rain soundtrack plays everytime there is hints of noona romance, that actually isn’t that romantic. There are so many other references in the drama as well, some of which include: Harry Potter, The Guest, SKY Castle, Suicide Squad, Forrest Gump, The X-Files, Kill Bill, Love Actually, and Kimi No Nawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The show also manages to deliver some really heartfelt and touching moments in between all the silly wackiness. All of the main cast get to show of their weaknesses, their dreams and their aspirations which makes the viewer really connect with them. It gives the show a lot of heart and makes the joke really count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This show is riddled with plot holes and the story is definitely something that comes second whereas the comedy comes first. The natural progression of a story is thrown out of the window for the sake of comedy. While there is nothing inherently wrong with that, it would be more impressive if they could balance the two aspects at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The comedy by repetition can be pretty funny, but at the same time it can also get really stale when they just spend too much time repeating the same joke over and over again. If you find the joke funny to begin with, it’s probably gonna get even funnier, but if you didn’t enjoy it, you’ll wish they just stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) That one suicide joke in episode 14 just didn’t sit right with me. It felt so unnecessary. Considering the very high youth suicide rates in South Korea, I just cannot fathom why the writers would think this was a good idea. There is nothing wrong with dark comedy but when it comes out of left field in an otherwise lighthearted series it just feels out of place and unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Due to its sitcom nature, the story lacks continuity. Unlike in season 1 where there is the baby left at the Waikiki guesthouse acting as an overarching plot thread that ties everything together, there is a lack of such a thing in season 2. That results in the story line not coming together in the same way. One possibility that they could have utilized was to put the missing father of the character Han Soo Yeon more at the center of the story to act like a similar plot device to the baby in season 1. Another way in which the story lacks continuity is through characters coming in and out of the story so frequently even when they should realistically be present more often. One such character is the landlord of the guesthouse who just disappears after the first few episodes. The guesthouse is also quite inconsistent since at times it feels like an actual guesthouse where there are actual guests living while at other times it just feels like our main casts dorm or collective living where they lounge about however they please without anyone else coming in or out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is a perfect pick-me-up drama to watch whenever you are feeling like watching something fun but don’t go in expecting a mind blowing story. The comedy mostly hits the mark and it is occasionally quite touching. My single biggest wish would be that the story was more coherent, which would significantly improve the quality of the story writing.&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post).

She worked as a lawyer and hosted a current affairs TV program prior to becoming a lawmaker. She is ambitious and does her job well.

We have some really fun questions about drama watching habits, drama preferences, language, travel, etc. There is a stickied post at the top of the subreddit with the link. Don&amp;#39;t be shy! Participate! Be counted! Results will be available in a separate post in a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, thank you all for making this community work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is the moment,&lt;/p&gt;

Han Gyul (acted by the awesome Gong Yoo) and Eun Chan (acted by Yoon Eun Hye) in 'Coffee Prince'.
Well, their chemistry was on fire🔥❤️ Han Gyul and Eun Chan looked so natural together and their kisses are still to this date one of the best/ most passionate in dramaland!! 💋 Gotta enjoy their friendship and""bromance"", how Han Gyul and Eun Chan made a pact to be ""brothers"" (before Han Gyul found out about Eun Chan's true gender) ... I enjoyed their relationship with each other as friends, and also as lovers. No awkwardess or anything between them , all felt gennuine and real. And I doubt anyone could forget about Han Gyul's confession of love towards Eun Chan , one of the most memorable confessions in dramaland~ 

Se Ryung (acted by Moon Chae Won) and Seung Yoo (acted by Park Shi Hoo) in 'The Princess' Man'.
This is often called the Joseon version of Romeo and Juliet. A deep, intense love between the OTP. The OTP started out as carefree, cute and sweet without any worries in the world... but that later turned everything upside down when Seung Yoo finds out that his love's father is the person he hates more than anything. Everything gets angsty, tragic , complicated and full of heartache... I don't wanna spoil too much for those who haven't seen it but the chemistry between MCW and PSH is amazing...  One can totally feel the love and yearning those two lovers holds for each other. Also, I totally get why this is called The Princess' man, because Se Ryung is so loyal to her man, fights for him and risks her life for him many times etc. She is also so admirable 'cuz she is so strong willed! 

Boong Do (acted by Ji Hyun Woo) and Hee Jin (acted by Yoo In Na) in 'Queen In Hyun's Man'. 
Wow, just wow... their chemistry is to die for and it's no wonder really 'cuz JHW and YIA had a thing for each other during the filming and even dated each other for a while afterwards! Their kisses are so swoon worthy and all their scenes together so natural. I love how they were so caring and trusting of each other from the start... and that Boong Do is such good looking gentleman and Hee Jin so freakin' adorableee~ Theyre so supportive of each other and respects the other one so well, one can really tell how much in love they are. It's truly a sweet time travel romance that every hopeless romantic at heart should watch!! Their relationship is GOALS in my opinion. It's just a delight to watch those two being all lovely dovey together, not much angst between them... the only thing that's a hindrance to their relationship is that they're both from different time...

&lt;p&gt;[edit] thanks all for the responses so far! they&amp;#39;ve also helped me to better understand the question i&amp;#39;d wanted to ask - which is liking &lt;strong&gt;an actor/actress vs liking an actor/actress&amp;#39; performance/portrayal of characters&lt;/strong&gt;. :) [/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office""&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/a&gt; episodes 6 - 8.

**Introduction:**

The next part of the review series is here! To start of with, I’d like to thank everyone for the love and support that Part 1 got which has motivated me to keep writing. I wouldn’t be doing these posts if not for this lovely community. For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.

Before I get started with Part 2, I would like to say a few things. Compared to January, I don’t think the dramas that were released in February were as strong. As a result there are quite a few negative and lukewarm reviews in this post. I know I am not going to make myself popular by putting these opinions out there but I feel it would be disingenuous to say I think a drama is better than what I actually think just to have a more favorable reception. As usual, I will argue why I have said opinions of a certain show and I encourage you lovely people to argue against me if you think my stance or score is unfair. Just to make it clear, I don’t rate shows averagely because I hate kdramas. It’s rather the opposite, I love kdramas, otherwise I wouldn’t be putting so much effort into these posts. Since I love kdramas, I want to shine light on what I think is really good, and if I were to give everything a great score then that would devalue what I think are the actually great shows. I will be returning to form with more positive reviews for the March post, I promise.

With that being said, let’s get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**February**

&amp;#x200B;

**Touch Your Heart - TvN**

Romcom drama about an attorney and a movie star who find unexpected love when opposites attract.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The hype surrounding these two main leads coming together once again was immense, but even though expectations were sky high, I think they both lived up to the hype. Yes, obviously their characters are different from their previous drama Goblin, since this is a different series, yet the characters and the actors’ performances are great in their own right.

Yoo In Na’s portrayal of Oh Yun Seo is great. This is not her first time portraying an actress on screen and there have been many comparisons between Oh Yun Seo and her roles in Queen In Hyun’s Man and My Love From The Stars as well as fellow actress Jun Ji Hyun’s character from said drama. Yet, the presentation of Oh Yun Seo feels distinctly different and charming on its own. Even though she is childish, airheaded and naive, the audience quickly comes to root for Yun Seo as she is genuine, cute and very human. Lee Dong Wook as the lawyer Kwon Jung Rok is no slouch either as he put up a really good performance. At first he comes off as cold and unfriendly but we soon learn that he is upstanding, caring and sweet. Both of the actors manage to display great duality in their characters showing us that there are many sides to a person and that first impressions aren’t everything.

The contrast between the two main lead characters are shown throughout the different aspects of the drama, even down to the set design. Oh Yun Seo’s apartment and desk is bright, cute, fluffy and playful. Kwon Jung Rok’s apartment and desk is traditional, serious, toned down and functional. It truly feels like these characters work and live in these spaces and have made them their own.

(2) Despite how enjoyable both the leads are to watch, the best acting performance of the drama definitely belongs to Kim Dae Gon who plays a butcher’s son with a mental disability and does so in a convincing fashion. He really sells it with his portrayal of a naive and neurotic man who ends up in a lot of trouble regardless of his good intentions. Along with him and many others, the supporting cast are for the most part quite charismatic and memorable. Each character has their own quirks and add either humor or weight to the drama.

(3) I really like the camera movement of this drama and also the times at which they chose to incorporate camera movement. The camera movement is smooth in the use of zooms, pans, tilts, trucking, dollies and pedestals. Better yet, the movement rarely feels overused or like it’s something that was thrown in just for visual interest. Sometimes, just having a stationary shot creates a more pleasant viewing and allows the actor to really pierce through the screen, which creates more emotion.

(4) Besides just the camera movement, many other aspects of how the drama was shot is also really well done. I really like how a lot of interactions between our main leads are filmed. Instead of just relying on over-shoulder-shots for much of their conversations, the director often uses two-shots of them in either a full shot size or ¾ shot size. At the beginning it emphasises on how standoffish their relationship is whereas later on it emphasises their romantic chemistry.

Another really creative thing that the director does in the drama is to use character positions as visual indicators. This allows for group conversations to be filmed without constantly establishing the speaker with a close up, instead it becomes apparent who is speaking through who is leaning forward or somehow has a position that sets them aside from non-speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The drama falls into a lot of clichés and is often predictable. You know what you are going to get and that is both a strength and a weakness. Some people might find this drama to be überfluff and just way too sweet and cutesy, but fortunately for me, I have a sweet tooth. It is directed by the same person who directed “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim”, which shares the same fluffy feel-good romcom formula. I believe that formula is quite polarizing and will draw some viewers in while pushing other viewers out. The premise is not something very unique either considering it is one of the many office romance dramas to air this year where the man is the boss and the woman is his subordinate.

(2) Sometimes the characters act out of character just to create tension and drama. The most noticeable instance of this happening is &gt;!during episode 13 when the drama decides to incorporate the frustrating noble idiocy trope. Characters who once had great trust and communication suddenly stop talking and decide to be angsty by themselves, leading to great frustration for the viewer and inconsistent characterization.!&lt;

(3) Some of the subplots are just not that well thought out or executed. As it mostly takes place at Always Law Firm, this drama does have several legal plots and although I’m not an attorney, I can say that the courtroom scenes are not very believable and sometimes lack proper logic or courtroom etiquette. To be fair, this is expected from pretty much all kdramas that are not specifically legal dramas though, but the execution could absolutely have been better. There are two ways that it could have been solved, either invest time into better research and writing for these scenes or go more over-the-top with them to make them humorous and not to be taken seriously. Furthermore, there are subplots that go nowhere and are not very well structured such as the whole plot line about the creepy stalker of Oh Yun Seo.

Since my proficiency in Korean is only of the level that my regular intake of writing mostly consists of webcomics and children’s books, I haven’t read the web novel “Jinsimi Dadda” from which the story is adapted. Thus, I do not know if the flaws in the show’s writing comes from the screenwriter or just as a product of making a faithful adaptation. Therefore, I will not comment on that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- It is not a very deep or original drama, but it doesn’t try to be that either. It executes what it’s going for pretty well and I think the great acting, set design and camera work justifies the score.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Trap - OCN**

Crime thriller drama about a family man who ends up involved with a group of people who enjoy hunting humans.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The plot is really gritty and has a lot of twists and turns. No character feels like they are safe and it truly feels like anything can happen. Important characters get killed or have their lives ruined without warning. It’s one of those dramas that grabs your full attention with its thriller elements. The thriller elements in combination with the series only having 7 episodes makes for a perfect series to binge-watch it in one sitting. The drama doesn’t have room to drag or get boring. As a result of only having 7 episodes, it feels pretty tightly written. Not once throughout the show’s runtime did I feel myself getting disinterested in the story. Despite being very thrilling, Trap doesn’t fall into the Michael Bay category of just being high octane constantly which ultimately feels flat. Trap had its quiet moments too which allows it to build up to the climactic scenes and the suspense become more tangible than in a series that just puts the pedal the metal and never lets go.

(2) Sung Dong Il is a really good actor as always. In Trap, he plays detective Go Dong Kook who is close to retiring but decides to take on one last case. Sung Dong Il has almost 30 years of acting experience and you can really tell. Due to his age he rarely gets main roles in Kdramas nowadays and is often cast as a side character. Therefore, it is really refreshing to see him get so much spotlight in the role of a main character next to Lee Seo Jin who plays Kang Woo Hyun.

(3) In the context of a kdrama, the story and premise is quite unique. There is some good usage of metaphors with the whole hunting and trap motif that runs throughout the story. The metaphor is referred to in the background even, such as when Go Dong Kook is in the museum and the guide is talking about how humans evolved to invent tools that allowed us to become hunters. This acts as foreshadowing to the twisted hunting group that think they have evolved further than the rest of humanity and they use this logic to justify their hunting of other humans.

(4) The cinematography is mostly really good. They do a good job with keeping the eyelines lined up correctly even in scenes that are more complex. They use some pretty cool drone shots sweeping over the landscape showing of the setting and having the added bonus of looking really gorgeous as the scenery is filled with autumn forests and winding country roads. Some crane shots are also used in the show in order to extend shots that would otherwise have required multiple cuts, which creates great momentum and fluidity. Even some of the handheld camera movement is surprisingly solid in the sense that it doesn’t involve too much shaky cam and it tracks the character movement well keeping them in frame but with enough space to allow for you to see actions that happens around them.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama tries to execute a really difficult way of storytelling and it doesn’t work out very well as the execution of said technique is just so hard. &gt;!In my opinion, executing a plot twist which involves an unreliable narrator is so hard to get right in cinematic form, as opposed to in a novel. The reason for this is because in a drama or a movie, the filmmakers have to show us shots that the unreliable narrator possibly couldn't have known about or been apart of, such as other characters actions and dialogue or establishing shots when the narrator is not on screen. This makes the viewer feel cheated since the producers show us additional lies that the narrator is not telling us. I just felt like the series crumbled when they couldn't execute this properly, which I don't blame them for since it is very difficult to do. One sign of a plot twist being really good is that it adds to the rewatch value of the show, but with the plot twist of this show you don’t get the satisfaction of seeing the puzzle come together upon a rewatch as the twist is just ”I lied”. The ”I lied” twist can be used in an interesting way such as seen in Primal Fear (1996), but one main error that Trap commits is that it explicitly explains all of its misdirections to us rather than letting the audience discover these for themselves either by thinking back on the show or upon a rewatch.!&lt;

(2) I also felt like the filmmakers tried to be dark for the sake of being dark rather than for plot reasons, which comes of as a bit pretentious and overly edgy to me. But hey, to each their own, we all have different standards for what comes off as trying to hard. One of the most important aspects when writing a dark story is to write morally grey characters that have proper motivations for doing bad things so that the viewers can understand the characters actions. A prototypical example of this would be Walter White from Breaking Bad (2008) who turns to selling meth but has understandable motivations for doing so since he has cancer and needs to take care of his family. Among Korean series, Stranger (2017) would be a great example of an ensemble of well written morally ambiguous characters with proper motivations. The motivations of killing and doing bad deeds in Trap mostly just stop at ”I do it because I’m a psychopath”, which applies to the majority of the cast, except for the two main characters &gt;!who are looking for revenge even though Kang Woo Hyun does it because he is a psychopath as well.!&lt;

(3) The way they tried to wrap up the ending was quite disappointing. There are way too many plot threads left hanging. I don’t mind setting up for a sequel if that is what they are going for, but that should be done with some tact. Make sure to finish the current arc and then you can throw out a bit of teaser in the vane of ”it’s not over yet”. In this drama they just abandoned the first main arc of the story about 90% done and then called it a day. There are no signs of a season 2 ever happening either which results in a pretty unsatisfying situation as the viewer doesn’t get any closure.

(4) There are some really crappy visual effects in this drama. For instance, the fire in the opening scene is painful to look at. The flames are so obviously added in digitally through post production as you can tell they are on a different layer than the physical scene, there is some artifacting on the flames, the movement of the flames is predictable since they are animated and there is little to no smoke added in digitally to boot.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,0 / 10* \- The concept for this drama is excellent and it’s accompanied by good actors and cinematography but the poor effects and especially the writing hiccups impacted the drama quite negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Light in Your Eyes - JTBC**

Melodrama with elements of romance and comedy about a woman who has the ability to turn back time but at the price of growing old. The drama showcases the joys and hardships of growing old.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The choreography is really strong throughout the drama. They have probably the nicest shots of scenery and nature out of all the dramas of the year so far. From the lonely bus stop at night which we’ve all cried at once or twice in our lives, to the waves crashing in on the sandy beach while seagulls flock above, this drama is filled with eye candy that really fits each scene.

They also use plenty of creative camera angles. I am weak for angles in which they film from within different confined space which then frames the character on the outside of the confined space. Thus, one of my favorite shots happen early on when the mischievous Young Soo reaches in under the sink after a portable grill and he almost touches the camera as the scene is being filmed from under the sink. It’s just such a cool and creative camera angle.

(2) The ending of episode 10. It’s impossible to talk about this drama without talking about this part of the show. If you haven’t watched the show and don’t want to get spoiled, just skip to the next talking point, just know that this episode is one of the most impactful episodes of this year. &gt;!This plot twist changes everything about the drama and explains a lot of the intentionally written plot points that do not make sense. The chronology and the lack of realism is all explained by Hye Ja actually being a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. The twist is the key that unlocks the drama and allows you to fully understand all the confusing moments that were brought about earlier in the drama. This type of a twist where the events of the plots are all part of an imaginary world was popularized by the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1890) by Ambrose Bierce. As the story gets more incoherent and more and more unlikely events take place, the reader/viewer starts to realize that something fishy is going on. What is really going on behind the scenes is masked by memories that are all distorted and mixed up until the final reveal when it becomes clear that the rest of the story is just the memories of a person at the end of their lives.!&lt;

&gt;!This type of a twist operates very similarly to the ”it was all a dream” type twists in that much of the film took part outside of the ”real world”. This sort of a twist can be quite controversial as when it’s executed poorly it leaves the viewer with a sense that they wasted their time. However, it can be used to great effect, which I think is the case for The Light in Your Eyes. As far as cinema goes probably the best example of a well executed ”it was all a dream” twists can be found in the classic movie ”The Wizard of Oz” (1939), paving the way by showing that this twist can be used to achieve other purposes other than as an easy out for writers who have written themselves into a corner. In both stories, the dream experiences are used to cope with their respective main characters’ problems. As for Hye Ja, she gets to experience an existence wherein she saves her son (or father in the dream) from an accident that crippled him, which is a sort of trigger for her as indicated by that incident being what made her imagine herself as her real age even in her visions.!&lt;

(3) I really enjoy the setting and all the set design that comes along with it. There are no chaebols or rich people with shallow problems in this show. Most of the people are dirt poor and work their fingers to the bone to survive. They have true grit and their hardships form tight bonds between the characters. The setting reflects this beautifully as all the locations are humble and look like actual places where working class people live and work.

The setting is also great as it fits within the larger overarching narrative of the show. &gt;!More specifically my point is that someone who is old like Hye Ja, grew up and experienced the South Korea of old when living conditions where rough and many regular people were struggling to put food on the table, and therefore would imagine their imaginary world as such too.!&lt;

(4) The different family relationships that are portrayed are simply beautiful. Although the relationship between Hye Ja and Dae Sang is really touching, the strongest out of all is the mother-daughter relationship between Hye Ja and Jung Eun. Speaking of which I think, Lee Jung Eun who plays Jung Eun puts in the best performance out of all the actors. I’ve come to like her in all the dramas I’ve seen with her because she always rocks it with her ability to do both serious and comedy roles.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) Although the acting is good from the main cast and they each have a few stand out scenes, none of them blew me away. Han Jimin as the young Kim Hye Ja did well enough with the screen time she got. Nam Joo Hyuk as Hye Ja’s love interest Lee Joon Ha did better than he usually does but was helped out a fair bit in his difficult scenes with some really good writing carrying him a bit. Son Ho Jun as Hye Ja’s brother Kim Young Soo does fairly well with a relatively flat character, giving him some charm. Kim Hye Ja as the old Kim Hye Ja puts up a really solid and experienced performance. Overall, there is that little extra something missing from taking these good performances to great performances.

(2) The show is incredibly slow for the most part. If you imagine a show with average pacing is paced like a light jog, then this drama is a slow crawl. I understand that it is to match how slow Hye Ja has become once she has grown old but it’s not a very pleasant viewing experience. Plot points keep repeating which makes sense within the context of the show but it does not make for an interesting watch when you are left with deja vu every fifteen minutes, thinking “wait, didn’t I just watch this happen last episode?” You could skip past multiple episodes in the middle section of the drama and not be missing out on a lot of important plot information. At least the show runners made a good call by making this drama 12 episodes instead of 16, which would have slowed down the pace even further.

(3) The whole point of the majority of the show is that it’s supposed to not make sense. They have a good plot reason for it but it still is frustrating for the viewer at times. The very first inconsistency was the writers changing how the magical clock worked against what was already established. At first, Hye Ja could determine the amount of time that she could rewind and the amount of time that she lived through multiple times corresponded with her aging process, which I found really clever. Then they decided to uproot the established powers of the watch altogether when she enters the time loop. This all gets an explanation towards the end of the show, but by then the viewer has already grown annoyed at all the plot points that do not make sense. Sometimes, however, they make great use of the whole nonsensical backdrop through some hilarious scenes such as &gt;!the whole uprising of the elderly against the scamming elderly center.!&lt;

(4) To get the full experience of this drama, you have to watch it one time without being spoiled and then you have to rewatch it with all the knowledge at hand that you learn from your first watch-through. This might be way too much time to invest for most viewers especially as it is not the most viewer friendly drama to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,5 / 10* \- It’s a very nice drama to analyze and pick apart. However, the first time viewing experience wasn’t all that great due to the slow pace, repeating plot points and the fact that most of the show is written intentionally to not make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Item - MBC**

Fantasy crime thriller drama about items with mysterious magical powers and the people who wield them.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The opening works great as a hook to get the viewers invested in the show. It shows that they spent a fair bit of time and effort on getting the opening to be polished and eye catching.

(2) The set design is actually really cool for the most part. There is a good blend of physical sets and CGI backgrounds which make for intriguing scenery in a lot of scenes. This is great as many of the places throughout the drama become memorable and recognizable so that the viewer is aware of where the scenes are taking place without needing many establishing shots. There is one glaring exception that comes to mind and it is this abomination of a magic castle that looks like it is straight out of a Playstation game when seen up close. Otherwise, the creators did a good job with the sets and the backgrounds.

(3) I never thought I would make a parallel between these two series given the difference in quality, but the profiling scenes in the show are really cool in how they are shot and visualized, and it reminds me of the profiling scenes in Stranger (2017).

(4) Some of the special effects themselves look really good. All the particle effects they use for face swapping and sucking someone’s soul out look really good for drama standards.

(5) Some of the acting performances are pretty good. Kim Min Kyo who plays the inmate Bang Hak Jae only has a minor part but radiates more charisma than anyone else on the show. Lee Jung Hyun who plays the gangster Go Dae Soo also shows off some acting prowess. Everyone else is decent except for the the first and second female lead whose acting is really dull especially when they have to play against each other in the same scene.

(6) The soundtrack is pretty good and fits the series well. It’s by no means the best soundtrack of the year but it definitely gets the job done.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

I’m going to be completely honest. This is the worst drama I have ever seen. As I didn’t want that to be a baseless accusation, I tried to go to the bottom of why I really cannot stand it.

(1) This drama is a very good example of a production being in way over their heads. The premise is really cool but the project is way too ambitious for what they are working with. I actually took the time to sit down and read the original webtoon also called “Item” that the drama is based on to find out if it is any better. There is no translation of it so it took me a while since my Korean could definitely be better, but I got through it. I can confidently say that the story is more suited to the pages of a comic. This didn’t need an adaptation and the adaptation does not do the source material justice.

Usually, this type of a story is usually a bit of an adaptation nightmare. Just look at how many superhero movies have been complete trainwrecks for Hollywood productions to adapt from the comic books. Yes, there are movies from the MCU and Nolan’s Batman that are excellent, but there is also a fair share of Fantastic Four, Affleck’s Daredevil and plenty of other misses. This is despite Hollywood’s astronomical resources and budgets. Now imagine having to make an equally difficult adaptation, but needing to produce a 16 hour long series, in a shorter timespan, with less resource. That is how you end up with a product like MBC’s Item.

(2) This show starts off decently, albeit a little slow, but soon goes off the tracks really quickly as they just keep introducing more and more magical items with different effects. The powers of some items are extremely inconsistent and suddenly do something completely different from what has already been established, simply because it is convenient.

(3) The conflict between the hero and the villain is poorly written. The antagonist is just way too overpowered. At the same time he is also poorly developed. A properly developed antagonist character has more character depth than being extremely strong and a more complex motivation than being really mean. Good thing the protagonist has the strongest plot armor ever. He can be bleeding out of his mouth due to damaged internal organs and not go to the hospital and walk around like nothing ever happened a couple of hours later. Seems legit. Most of the time when he is in a sticky situation he gets out of it through a deus ex machina; for instance, someone completely unintroduced showing up with powers that haven’t been established in the middle of nowhere on a country road no matter how unlikely it seems.

(4) The editing and direction of some of the action scenes is really rough. It’s hard to follow character positions, what is really going on and who is doing what due to poor planning in either the form of choreography, storyboarding and direction as well as poor execution in either camera work or the editing process.

For a fantasy series with a lot of potential for cool battles with mysterious magic, there is very little of that and a lot of gunfights. On top of that, there is a lack of understanding how guns work, resulting in some poor looking gun-firing scenes. For one, they rarely add a muzzle flash for when a gun is shot. The choreography of the people being shot looks quite clumsy and awkward as they just kind of stumble backwards. No one ever cocks their weapon as they apparently all run around with their weapons with the safety off. We never see shell casing pop out off a firearm even though multiple shots are fired. On top of that, we see the usual problems that film encounters with firearms. The weapons barely have any recoil. Ammunition is never a problem. Everyone fires non-suppressed guns without ear protection. I don’t expect full realism, I just want the filmmakers to try somewhat when they make a action series involving guns. In this drama, they just didn’t care and there is no good plot reason for the guns to be completely unrealistic like for instance being in a computer world, such as in The Matrix (1999).

(5) Some of the special effects are a bit poorly executed which results in them breaking the immersion quite a bit. The largest problem regarding the special effects is with lighting and shadows. Things that are computer generated that emit light should act like a real light source and spread light on the surroundings and make objects cast shadows. It isn’t enough to just generate the object you want on screen digitally, you also have to generate the effects the object has on its surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 3,0 / 10* \- This drama ended up being pretty terrible as the show makers tried to create a show that was way too difficult to execute for what they were working with.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Fiery Priest - SBS**

Action comedy drama about a priest out to punish all the wrong doers of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The acting is pretty good. Kim Nam Gil and Kim Sung Kyun are pretty good in their roles as priest Kim Hae Il and detective Go Dae Young, and get to show some acting range. Ahn Chang Wan and Go Kyu Pil make up a really hilarious duo as Song Sac, the Thai guy with a huge heart and Yo Han, the convenience store part timer with a degree in astrophysics. Shoutout also to Geum Sae Rok doing a pretty decent job as newly hired detective Seo Seung Ah considering she is a rookie actress.

(2) There is character development to some degree. For example, detective Go Dae Young learns that it’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees &gt;!and eventually goes back to fighting injustice like he once did.!&lt;

(3) The back half of this show is way better than the first half. It feels like the entire production got a lot more comfortable and the quality definitely improved over time. The writing gets tighter, the actors get more accustomed to their roles and the humour started hitting the mark a lot more often by abandoning the attempts to achieve laughs by screaming and instead upping the wackiness factor.

(4) I respect the decision not to go down the path of any potential romance plots. Not every drama needs a romance main plot or sub plot and considering that 72% of dramas listed in 2018 has a romance tag attached to it, it’s rather refreshing to see a pretty light hearted show not opt for any romance stories.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama is lacking in both direction and writing, which can be attributed to the people spearheading the production. This drama is from the director of the tragic Fashion King, Lee Myung Woo and the hit or miss writer Park Jae Bum, who wrote the poorly written Blood along with some good dramas like Chief Kim. There are actually some similarities between this and Chief Kim but The Fiery Priest lacks some of the charisma that Chief Kim had, possibly due to the lack of Namgoong Min. Overall, the combination of these two as lead creators results in the drama lacking focus, being predictable, and relying way too heavily on cheap gags instead of any more elaborate humor.

(2) The tone of the drama is everywhere. It goes from being very serious one moment to being a silly comedy the next. Now some people may enjoy that style, for me it just creates cognitive dissonance. These types of jarring tonal shifts, where a show switches between a wacky comedy with cartoony visual and sound effects and serious crime drama, are really hard to execute in my opinion, and I don’t really think they succeeded with it in this show. The drama tries to deal with serious topics such as PTSD, xenophobia, corruption, (alleged) suicide and molestation within the Catholic church. However, all of this gets buried under the wacky humour. The serious bits also take away from the humour as the viewer is not inclined to laugh right after having seen a tragic scene such as&gt;!seeing a dozen kids being blown to pieces by a hand grenade.!&lt;

(3) Although there is a lot of fighting in this show that is pretty well choreographed, especially the scenes of former junior martial arts athlete Go Joon, it barely ever carries any consequences which makes the fighting feel rather pointless. An important character can beaten nearly to death and the next day run around like they are fine unless the plot requires them to die/end up in a coma. It severely lowers the stakes of the serious action scenes, while at the same brutal scenes of violence impedes the notion that the series is supposed to be funny. Then again, maybe we are not supposed to take the violent scenes seriously considering the makeup work to recreate injuries looks almost cartoony. Real bruises don’t turn blue right after an injury, it takes around 24 hours for it to go from red to blue.

(4) The plot takes a long time to really get going. The main arc of the drama &gt;!which is the team fully gathered up and standing against the bad guys!&lt; starts taking place around 13 hours into the drama. The writer put a lot of obstacles in the way of plot progression and almost all of them can be explained with “corruption”. They use corruption as a constant be-all and end-all solution to ensure that the protagonist makes no progress. There is no need for this drama to be 40 episodes each spanning 30 minutes. Some tighter writing could have easily cut this 20 hour drama into a 16 or even 12 hour drama.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 6,5 / 10* \- This is not going to be a popular score with the majority and to be honest, this is one of those dramas that I understand the appeal of for other people, but I don’t see it’s greatness myself. The first half hovered somewhere around a 5 for me while the back half was closer to an 8. Overall, I feel like a 6,5 is a fair score for me personally. However, I do acknowledge that this drama is probably going to be very influential on a lot of upcoming kdramas due to its immense popularity in Korea.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the review series is here! To start of with, I’d like to thank everyone for the love and support that Part 1 got which has motivated me to keep writing. I wouldn’t be doing these posts if not for this lovely community. For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get started with Part 2, I would like to say a few things. Compared to January, I don’t think the dramas that were released in February were as strong. As a result there are quite a few negative and lukewarm reviews in this post. I know I am not going to make myself popular by putting these opinions out there but I feel it would be disingenuous to say I think a drama is better than what I actually think just to have a more favorable reception. As usual, I will argue why I have said opinions of a certain show and I encourage you lovely people to argue against me if you think my stance or score is unfair. Just to make it clear, I don’t rate shows averagely because I hate kdramas. It’s rather the opposite, I love kdramas, otherwise I wouldn’t be putting so much effort into these posts. Since I love kdramas, I want to shine light on what I think is really good, and if I were to give everything a great score then that would devalue what I think are the actually great shows. I will be returning to form with more positive reviews for the March post, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Your Heart - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romcom drama about an attorney and a movie star who find unexpected love when opposites attract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The hype surrounding these two main leads coming together once again was immense, but even though expectations were sky high, I think they both lived up to the hype. Yes, obviously their characters are different from their previous drama Goblin, since this is a different series, yet the characters and the actors’ performances are great in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoo In Na’s portrayal of Oh Yun Seo is great. This is not her first time portraying an actress on screen and there have been many comparisons between Oh Yun Seo and her roles in Queen In Hyun’s Man and My Love From The Stars as well as fellow actress Jun Ji Hyun’s character from said drama. Yet, the presentation of Oh Yun Seo feels distinctly different and charming on its own. Even though she is childish, airheaded and naive, the audience quickly comes to root for Yun Seo as she is genuine, cute and very human. Lee Dong Wook as the lawyer Kwon Jung Rok is no slouch either as he put up a really good performance. At first he comes off as cold and unfriendly but we soon learn that he is upstanding, caring and sweet. Both of the actors manage to display great duality in their characters showing us that there are many sides to a person and that first impressions aren’t everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the two main lead characters are shown throughout the different aspects of the drama, even down to the set design. Oh Yun Seo’s apartment and desk is bright, cute, fluffy and playful. Kwon Jung Rok’s apartment and desk is traditional, serious, toned down and functional. It truly feels like these characters work and live in these spaces and have made them their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Despite how enjoyable both the leads are to watch, the best acting performance of the drama definitely belongs to Kim Dae Gon who plays a butcher’s son with a mental disability and does so in a convincing fashion. He really sells it with his portrayal of a naive and neurotic man who ends up in a lot of trouble regardless of his good intentions. Along with him and many others, the supporting cast are for the most part quite charismatic and memorable. Each character has their own quirks and add either humor or weight to the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I really like the camera movement of this drama and also the times at which they chose to incorporate camera movement. The camera movement is smooth in the use of zooms, pans, tilts, trucking, dollies and pedestals. Better yet, the movement rarely feels overused or like it’s something that was thrown in just for visual interest. Sometimes, just having a stationary shot creates a more pleasant viewing and allows the actor to really pierce through the screen, which creates more emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Besides just the camera movement, many other aspects of how the drama was shot is also really well done. I really like how a lot of interactions between our main leads are filmed. Instead of just relying on over-shoulder-shots for much of their conversations, the director often uses two-shots of them in either a full shot size or ¾ shot size. At the beginning it emphasises on how standoffish their relationship is whereas later on it emphasises their romantic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another really creative thing that the director does in the drama is to use character positions as visual indicators. This allows for group conversations to be filmed without constantly establishing the speaker with a close up, instead it becomes apparent who is speaking through who is leaning forward or somehow has a position that sets them aside from non-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama falls into a lot of clichés and is often predictable. You know what you are going to get and that is both a strength and a weakness. Some people might find this drama to be überfluff and just way too sweet and cutesy, but fortunately for me, I have a sweet tooth. It is directed by the same person who directed “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim”, which shares the same fluffy feel-good romcom formula. I believe that formula is quite polarizing and will draw some viewers in while pushing other viewers out. The premise is not something very unique either considering it is one of the many office romance dramas to air this year where the man is the boss and the woman is his subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Sometimes the characters act out of character just to create tension and drama. The most noticeable instance of this happening is &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;during episode 13 when the drama decides to incorporate the frustrating noble idiocy trope. Characters who once had great trust and communication suddenly stop talking and decide to be angsty by themselves, leading to great frustration for the viewer and inconsistent characterization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some of the subplots are just not that well thought out or executed. As it mostly takes place at Always Law Firm, this drama does have several legal plots and although I’m not an attorney, I can say that the courtroom scenes are not very believable and sometimes lack proper logic or courtroom etiquette. To be fair, this is expected from pretty much all kdramas that are not specifically legal dramas though, but the execution could absolutely have been better. There are two ways that it could have been solved, either invest time into better research and writing for these scenes or go more over-the-top with them to make them humorous and not to be taken seriously. Furthermore, there are subplots that go nowhere and are not very well structured such as the whole plot line about the creepy stalker of Oh Yun Seo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my proficiency in Korean is only of the level that my regular intake of writing mostly consists of webcomics and children’s books, I haven’t read the web novel “Jinsimi Dadda” from which the story is adapted. Thus, I do not know if the flaws in the show’s writing comes from the screenwriter or just as a product of making a faithful adaptation. Therefore, I will not comment on that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is not a very deep or original drama, but it doesn’t try to be that either. It executes what it’s going for pretty well and I think the great acting, set design and camera work justifies the score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trap - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crime thriller drama about a family man who ends up involved with a group of people who enjoy hunting humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The plot is really gritty and has a lot of twists and turns. No character feels like they are safe and it truly feels like anything can happen. Important characters get killed or have their lives ruined without warning. It’s one of those dramas that grabs your full attention with its thriller elements. The thriller elements in combination with the series only having 7 episodes makes for a perfect series to binge-watch it in one sitting. The drama doesn’t have room to drag or get boring. As a result of only having 7 episodes, it feels pretty tightly written. Not once throughout the show’s runtime did I feel myself getting disinterested in the story. Despite being very thrilling, Trap doesn’t fall into the Michael Bay category of just being high octane constantly which ultimately feels flat. Trap had its quiet moments too which allows it to build up to the climactic scenes and the suspense become more tangible than in a series that just puts the pedal the metal and never lets go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Sung Dong Il is a really good actor as always. In Trap, he plays detective Go Dong Kook who is close to retiring but decides to take on one last case. Sung Dong Il has almost 30 years of acting experience and you can really tell. Due to his age he rarely gets main roles in Kdramas nowadays and is often cast as a side character. Therefore, it is really refreshing to see him get so much spotlight in the role of a main character next to Lee Seo Jin who plays Kang Woo Hyun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) In the context of a kdrama, the story and premise is quite unique. There is some good usage of metaphors with the whole hunting and trap motif that runs throughout the story. The metaphor is referred to in the background even, such as when Go Dong Kook is in the museum and the guide is talking about how humans evolved to invent tools that allowed us to become hunters. This acts as foreshadowing to the twisted hunting group that think they have evolved further than the rest of humanity and they use this logic to justify their hunting of other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The cinematography is mostly really good. They do a good job with keeping the eyelines lined up correctly even in scenes that are more complex. They use some pretty cool drone shots sweeping over the landscape showing of the setting and having the added bonus of looking really gorgeous as the scenery is filled with autumn forests and winding country roads. Some crane shots are also used in the show in order to extend shots that would otherwise have required multiple cuts, which creates great momentum and fluidity. Even some of the handheld camera movement is surprisingly solid in the sense that it doesn’t involve too much shaky cam and it tracks the character movement well keeping them in frame but with enough space to allow for you to see actions that happens around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama tries to execute a really difficult way of storytelling and it doesn’t work out very well as the execution of said technique is just so hard. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In my opinion, executing a plot twist which involves an unreliable narrator is so hard to get right in cinematic form, as opposed to in a novel. The reason for this is because in a drama or a movie, the filmmakers have to show us shots that the unreliable narrator possibly couldn&amp;#39;t have known about or been apart of, such as other characters actions and dialogue or establishing shots when the narrator is not on screen. This makes the viewer feel cheated since the producers show us additional lies that the narrator is not telling us. I just felt like the series crumbled when they couldn&amp;#39;t execute this properly, which I don&amp;#39;t blame them for since it is very difficult to do. One sign of a plot twist being really good is that it adds to the rewatch value of the show, but with the plot twist of this show you don’t get the satisfaction of seeing the puzzle come together upon a rewatch as the twist is just ”I lied”. The ”I lied” twist can be used in an interesting way such as seen in Primal Fear (1996), but one main error that Trap commits is that it explicitly explains all of its misdirections to us rather than letting the audience discover these for themselves either by thinking back on the show or upon a rewatch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) I also felt like the filmmakers tried to be dark for the sake of being dark rather than for plot reasons, which comes of as a bit pretentious and overly edgy to me. But hey, to each their own, we all have different standards for what comes off as trying to hard. One of the most important aspects when writing a dark story is to write morally grey characters that have proper motivations for doing bad things so that the viewers can understand the characters actions. A prototypical example of this would be Walter White from Breaking Bad (2008) who turns to selling meth but has understandable motivations for doing so since he has cancer and needs to take care of his family. Among Korean series, Stranger (2017) would be a great example of an ensemble of well written morally ambiguous characters with proper motivations. The motivations of killing and doing bad deeds in Trap mostly just stop at ”I do it because I’m a psychopath”, which applies to the majority of the cast, except for the two main characters &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;who are looking for revenge even though Kang Woo Hyun does it because he is a psychopath as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The way they tried to wrap up the ending was quite disappointing. There are way too many plot threads left hanging. I don’t mind setting up for a sequel if that is what they are going for, but that should be done with some tact. Make sure to finish the current arc and then you can throw out a bit of teaser in the vane of ”it’s not over yet”. In this drama they just abandoned the first main arc of the story about 90% done and then called it a day. There are no signs of a season 2 ever happening either which results in a pretty unsatisfying situation as the viewer doesn’t get any closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some really crappy visual effects in this drama. For instance, the fire in the opening scene is painful to look at. The flames are so obviously added in digitally through post production as you can tell they are on a different layer than the physical scene, there is some artifacting on the flames, the movement of the flames is predictable since they are animated and there is little to no smoke added in digitally to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The concept for this drama is excellent and it’s accompanied by good actors and cinematography but the poor effects and especially the writing hiccups impacted the drama quite negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Light in Your Eyes - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melodrama with elements of romance and comedy about a woman who has the ability to turn back time but at the price of growing old. The drama showcases the joys and hardships of growing old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The choreography is really strong throughout the drama. They have probably the nicest shots of scenery and nature out of all the dramas of the year so far. From the lonely bus stop at night which we’ve all cried at once or twice in our lives, to the waves crashing in on the sandy beach while seagulls flock above, this drama is filled with eye candy that really fits each scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also use plenty of creative camera angles. I am weak for angles in which they film from within different confined space which then frames the character on the outside of the confined space. Thus, one of my favorite shots happen early on when the mischievous Young Soo reaches in under the sink after a portable grill and he almost touches the camera as the scene is being filmed from under the sink. It’s just such a cool and creative camera angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The ending of episode 10. It’s impossible to talk about this drama without talking about this part of the show. If you haven’t watched the show and don’t want to get spoiled, just skip to the next talking point, just know that this episode is one of the most impactful episodes of this year. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;This plot twist changes everything about the drama and explains a lot of the intentionally written plot points that do not make sense. The chronology and the lack of realism is all explained by Hye Ja actually being a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. The twist is the key that unlocks the drama and allows you to fully understand all the confusing moments that were brought about earlier in the drama. This type of a twist where the events of the plots are all part of an imaginary world was popularized by the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1890) by Ambrose Bierce. As the story gets more incoherent and more and more unlikely events take place, the reader/viewer starts to realize that something fishy is going on. What is really going on behind the scenes is masked by memories that are all distorted and mixed up until the final reveal when it becomes clear that the rest of the story is just the memories of a person at the end of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;This type of a twist operates very similarly to the ”it was all a dream” type twists in that much of the film took part outside of the ”real world”. This sort of a twist can be quite controversial as when it’s executed poorly it leaves the viewer with a sense that they wasted their time. However, it can be used to great effect, which I think is the case for The Light in Your Eyes. As far as cinema goes probably the best example of a well executed ”it was all a dream” twists can be found in the classic movie ”The Wizard of Oz” (1939), paving the way by showing that this twist can be used to achieve other purposes other than as an easy out for writers who have written themselves into a corner. In both stories, the dream experiences are used to cope with their respective main characters’ problems. As for Hye Ja, she gets to experience an existence wherein she saves her son (or father in the dream) from an accident that crippled him, which is a sort of trigger for her as indicated by that incident being what made her imagine herself as her real age even in her visions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I really enjoy the setting and all the set design that comes along with it. There are no chaebols or rich people with shallow problems in this show. Most of the people are dirt poor and work their fingers to the bone to survive. They have true grit and their hardships form tight bonds between the characters. The setting reflects this beautifully as all the locations are humble and look like actual places where working class people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is also great as it fits within the larger overarching narrative of the show. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;More specifically my point is that someone who is old like Hye Ja, grew up and experienced the South Korea of old when living conditions where rough and many regular people were struggling to put food on the table, and therefore would imagine their imaginary world as such too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The different family relationships that are portrayed are simply beautiful. Although the relationship between Hye Ja and Dae Sang is really touching, the strongest out of all is the mother-daughter relationship between Hye Ja and Jung Eun. Speaking of which I think, Lee Jung Eun who plays Jung Eun puts in the best performance out of all the actors. I’ve come to like her in all the dramas I’ve seen with her because she always rocks it with her ability to do both serious and comedy roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the acting is good from the main cast and they each have a few stand out scenes, none of them blew me away. Han Jimin as the young Kim Hye Ja did well enough with the screen time she got. Nam Joo Hyuk as Hye Ja’s love interest Lee Joon Ha did better than he usually does but was helped out a fair bit in his difficult scenes with some really good writing carrying him a bit. Son Ho Jun as Hye Ja’s brother Kim Young Soo does fairly well with a relatively flat character, giving him some charm. Kim Hye Ja as the old Kim Hye Ja puts up a really solid and experienced performance. Overall, there is that little extra something missing from taking these good performances to great performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The show is incredibly slow for the most part. If you imagine a show with average pacing is paced like a light jog, then this drama is a slow crawl. I understand that it is to match how slow Hye Ja has become once she has grown old but it’s not a very pleasant viewing experience. Plot points keep repeating which makes sense within the context of the show but it does not make for an interesting watch when you are left with deja vu every fifteen minutes, thinking “wait, didn’t I just watch this happen last episode?” You could skip past multiple episodes in the middle section of the drama and not be missing out on a lot of important plot information. At least the show runners made a good call by making this drama 12 episodes instead of 16, which would have slowed down the pace even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The whole point of the majority of the show is that it’s supposed to not make sense. They have a good plot reason for it but it still is frustrating for the viewer at times. The very first inconsistency was the writers changing how the magical clock worked against what was already established. At first, Hye Ja could determine the amount of time that she could rewind and the amount of time that she lived through multiple times corresponded with her aging process, which I found really clever. Then they decided to uproot the established powers of the watch altogether when she enters the time loop. This all gets an explanation towards the end of the show, but by then the viewer has already grown annoyed at all the plot points that do not make sense. Sometimes, however, they make great use of the whole nonsensical backdrop through some hilarious scenes such as &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the whole uprising of the elderly against the scamming elderly center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) To get the full experience of this drama, you have to watch it one time without being spoiled and then you have to rewatch it with all the knowledge at hand that you learn from your first watch-through. This might be way too much time to invest for most viewers especially as it is not the most viewer friendly drama to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a very nice drama to analyze and pick apart. However, the first time viewing experience wasn’t all that great due to the slow pace, repeating plot points and the fact that most of the show is written intentionally to not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item - MBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantasy crime thriller drama about items with mysterious magical powers and the people who wield them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The opening works great as a hook to get the viewers invested in the show. It shows that they spent a fair bit of time and effort on getting the opening to be polished and eye catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The set design is actually really cool for the most part. There is a good blend of physical sets and CGI backgrounds which make for intriguing scenery in a lot of scenes. This is great as many of the places throughout the drama become memorable and recognizable so that the viewer is aware of where the scenes are taking place without needing many establishing shots. There is one glaring exception that comes to mind and it is this abomination of a magic castle that looks like it is straight out of a Playstation game when seen up close. Otherwise, the creators did a good job with the sets and the backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I never thought I would make a parallel between these two series given the difference in quality, but the profiling scenes in the show are really cool in how they are shot and visualized, and it reminds me of the profiling scenes in Stranger (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Some of the special effects themselves look really good. All the particle effects they use for face swapping and sucking someone’s soul out look really good for drama standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Some of the acting performances are pretty good. Kim Min Kyo who plays the inmate Bang Hak Jae only has a minor part but radiates more charisma than anyone else on the show. Lee Jung Hyun who plays the gangster Go Dae Soo also shows off some acting prowess. Everyone else is decent except for the the first and second female lead whose acting is really dull especially when they have to play against each other in the same scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The soundtrack is pretty good and fits the series well. It’s by no means the best soundtrack of the year but it definitely gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be completely honest. This is the worst drama I have ever seen. As I didn’t want that to be a baseless accusation, I tried to go to the bottom of why I really cannot stand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is a very good example of a production being in way over their heads. The premise is really cool but the project is way too ambitious for what they are working with. I actually took the time to sit down and read the original webtoon also called “Item” that the drama is based on to find out if it is any better. There is no translation of it so it took me a while since my Korean could definitely be better, but I got through it. I can confidently say that the story is more suited to the pages of a comic. This didn’t need an adaptation and the adaptation does not do the source material justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, this type of a story is usually a bit of an adaptation nightmare. Just look at how many superhero movies have been complete trainwrecks for Hollywood productions to adapt from the comic books. Yes, there are movies from the MCU and Nolan’s Batman that are excellent, but there is also a fair share of Fantastic Four, Affleck’s Daredevil and plenty of other misses. This is despite Hollywood’s astronomical resources and budgets. Now imagine having to make an equally difficult adaptation, but needing to produce a 16 hour long series, in a shorter timespan, with less resource. That is how you end up with a product like MBC’s Item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) This show starts off decently, albeit a little slow, but soon goes off the tracks really quickly as they just keep introducing more and more magical items with different effects. The powers of some items are extremely inconsistent and suddenly do something completely different from what has already been established, simply because it is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The conflict between the hero and the villain is poorly written. The antagonist is just way too overpowered. At the same time he is also poorly developed. A properly developed antagonist character has more character depth than being extremely strong and a more complex motivation than being really mean. Good thing the protagonist has the strongest plot armor ever. He can be bleeding out of his mouth due to damaged internal organs and not go to the hospital and walk around like nothing ever happened a couple of hours later. Seems legit. Most of the time when he is in a sticky situation he gets out of it through a deus ex machina; for instance, someone completely unintroduced showing up with powers that haven’t been established in the middle of nowhere on a country road no matter how unlikely it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The editing and direction of some of the action scenes is really rough. It’s hard to follow character positions, what is really going on and who is doing what due to poor planning in either the form of choreography, storyboarding and direction as well as poor execution in either camera work or the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fantasy series with a lot of potential for cool battles with mysterious magic, there is very little of that and a lot of gunfights. On top of that, there is a lack of understanding how guns work, resulting in some poor looking gun-firing scenes. For one, they rarely add a muzzle flash for when a gun is shot. The choreography of the people being shot looks quite clumsy and awkward as they just kind of stumble backwards. No one ever cocks their weapon as they apparently all run around with their weapons with the safety off. We never see shell casing pop out off a firearm even though multiple shots are fired. On top of that, we see the usual problems that film encounters with firearms. The weapons barely have any recoil. Ammunition is never a problem. Everyone fires non-suppressed guns without ear protection. I don’t expect full realism, I just want the filmmakers to try somewhat when they make a action series involving guns. In this drama, they just didn’t care and there is no good plot reason for the guns to be completely unrealistic like for instance being in a computer world, such as in The Matrix (1999).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Some of the special effects are a bit poorly executed which results in them breaking the immersion quite a bit. The largest problem regarding the special effects is with lighting and shadows. Things that are computer generated that emit light should act like a real light source and spread light on the surroundings and make objects cast shadows. It isn’t enough to just generate the object you want on screen digitally, you also have to generate the effects the object has on its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 3,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama ended up being pretty terrible as the show makers tried to create a show that was way too difficult to execute for what they were working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fiery Priest - SBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action comedy drama about a priest out to punish all the wrong doers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The acting is pretty good. Kim Nam Gil and Kim Sung Kyun are pretty good in their roles as priest Kim Hae Il and detective Go Dae Young, and get to show some acting range. Ahn Chang Wan and Go Kyu Pil make up a really hilarious duo as Song Sac, the Thai guy with a huge heart and Yo Han, the convenience store part timer with a degree in astrophysics. Shoutout also to Geum Sae Rok doing a pretty decent job as newly hired detective Seo Seung Ah considering she is a rookie actress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) There is character development to some degree. For example, detective Go Dae Young learns that it’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;and eventually goes back to fighting injustice like he once did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The back half of this show is way better than the first half. It feels like the entire production got a lot more comfortable and the quality definitely improved over time. The writing gets tighter, the actors get more accustomed to their roles and the humour started hitting the mark a lot more often by abandoning the attempts to achieve laughs by screaming and instead upping the wackiness factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) I respect the decision not to go down the path of any potential romance plots. Not every drama needs a romance main plot or sub plot and considering that 72% of dramas listed in 2018 has a romance tag attached to it, it’s rather refreshing to see a pretty light hearted show not opt for any romance stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama is lacking in both direction and writing, which can be attributed to the people spearheading the production. This drama is from the director of the tragic Fashion King, Lee Myung Woo and the hit or miss writer Park Jae Bum, who wrote the poorly written Blood along with some good dramas like Chief Kim. There are actually some similarities between this and Chief Kim but The Fiery Priest lacks some of the charisma that Chief Kim had, possibly due to the lack of Namgoong Min. Overall, the combination of these two as lead creators results in the drama lacking focus, being predictable, and relying way too heavily on cheap gags instead of any more elaborate humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The tone of the drama is everywhere. It goes from being very serious one moment to being a silly comedy the next. Now some people may enjoy that style, for me it just creates cognitive dissonance. These types of jarring tonal shifts, where a show switches between a wacky comedy with cartoony visual and sound effects and serious crime drama, are really hard to execute in my opinion, and I don’t really think they succeeded with it in this show. The drama tries to deal with serious topics such as PTSD, xenophobia, corruption, (alleged) suicide and molestation within the Catholic church. However, all of this gets buried under the wacky humour. The serious bits also take away from the humour as the viewer is not inclined to laugh right after having seen a tragic scene such as&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;seeing a dozen kids being blown to pieces by a hand grenade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Although there is a lot of fighting in this show that is pretty well choreographed, especially the scenes of former junior martial arts athlete Go Joon, it barely ever carries any consequences which makes the fighting feel rather pointless. An important character can beaten nearly to death and the next day run around like they are fine unless the plot requires them to die/end up in a coma. It severely lowers the stakes of the serious action scenes, while at the same brutal scenes of violence impedes the notion that the series is supposed to be funny. Then again, maybe we are not supposed to take the violent scenes seriously considering the makeup work to recreate injuries looks almost cartoony. Real bruises don’t turn blue right after an injury, it takes around 24 hours for it to go from red to blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The plot takes a long time to really get going. The main arc of the drama &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;which is the team fully gathered up and standing against the bad guys&lt;/span&gt; starts taking place around 13 hours into the drama. The writer put a lot of obstacles in the way of plot progression and almost all of them can be explained with “corruption”. They use corruption as a constant be-all and end-all solution to ensure that the protagonist makes no progress. There is no need for this drama to be 40 episodes each spanning 30 minutes. Some tighter writing could have easily cut this 20 hour drama into a 16 or even 12 hour drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 6,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This is not going to be a popular score with the majority and to be honest, this is one of those dramas that I understand the appeal of for other people, but I don’t see it’s greatness myself. The first half hovered somewhere around a 5 for me while the back half was closer to an 8. Overall, I feel like a 6,5 is a fair score for me personally. However, I do acknowledge that this drama is probably going to be very influential on a lot of upcoming kdramas due to its immense popularity in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Rules&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find them in our wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/rules""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Policies&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are available in the wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/policies""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Air Policy Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It&amp;#39;s a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what&amp;#39;s going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it&amp;#39;s best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There&amp;#39;s no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That&amp;#39;s where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Ratings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;General Tips and Tricks&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are using spoiler tags when discussing important plot details and other information. You can find the guide &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like italics, headings, and table formatting are done using markdown. You can find the guide &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/formatting_and_markdown""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm looking to start auditioning for roles in Netflix or Kdramas.

Can anyone point me to the right direction?Basically, I'm totally lost on where to start.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys,&lt;/p&gt;

In case you are curious, this is how they do it:

They sent me three thingies. Two to put in my apartment that through bluetooth signals knows if the main thingy is near by. The main thingy I am supposed to carry it around on me whenever I am awake. On the body. It can feel that it is close to the body. Like Fitbit or something. Then I gather ""points"" and for these points I can actually ""buy"" quite nice and expensive stuff. The thingy can hear ultrasound. 

Each TV-channel / streaming service that has agreed to partake in this measurement has its own ultrasound signal that they keep sending out at all times. So my personal thingy then measures how long time each signal is sent close to me. So that even if I watch on a mobile it will know what I am watching. Then each night it sends off the result to Kantar, who then make the statistics.

(I am not going to do it anyway because of various reasons.)

Ultrasaound: I don't like that these shows send out ultrasound all the time. Is it possible to adjust the monitor so that it doesn't send out ultrasound? I must find out. Some day. 

On representativeness: They told me they think it is around 4% wrong. I am thinking that even if they get the percentage of single women around fifty living alone right, the type of people who say yes to be measured will still be a bit special? I mean personality wise. On the other hand, all the streaming services will know the exact numbers of watchers for their own shows, so if Kantar gets it really wrong they will know it and complain / not pay. It is jointly paid for by the competitors so that they will know more about the competition.

EDIT: Kantar has a large office in Korea as well, so I presume they do the same there.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;By chance I was asked to become one of the &lt;em&gt;representatively select few&lt;/em&gt; in Norway who are measured on how much they watch of this and that.

&amp;#x200B;

**What is this?**

This is my take on most of the major kdramas that started airing after January 1 and ended before July 1. To narrow down the already large number of dramas, I decided to not include any drama specials, web dramas or movies.  I will be recapping the dramas in chronological order of when they started airing. Feel free to skip around freely between dramas, as reading the entire ordeal might be a bit much.

**Who am I?**

A passionate kdrama watcher who put my all into watching as many of the bigger shows of 2019 as possible. I have studied film and literature at university in Sweden and drama at university in the UK. However, I put that aside as more of a hobby and currently I’m pursuing a teaching degree.

**What do I want to achieve?**

I want to put my opinions out there and hopefully generate some interesting debates and discussions about the shows that have aired in the first half of 2019, as a sort of recap. I hope to inspire people to try some shows they might have otherwise dismissed. I also hope that you try to change my views on some shows I might see as lacking and critique my opinion of shows I might like. When it comes down to it, media is very subjective and most aspects of how you view it is up to personal opinion.

**A small note about Scores:**

Now I know, a score on a scale from 1 to 10 is not a good way to describe a drama. However, I decided to throw in what I scored each of these dramas on MyDramaList to make it a little spicy and hopefully generate more debate. If you think a drama got an unreasonable score, feel free to tell me but please motivate why it deserves a different score. Also, the amount of numbered talking points in relation to the good and bad aspects of a drama is in no relation to the score, they are just there to make it easier to read.

**A small note about Spoilers:**

I will try to use spoiler tags wherever needed, in order for people who haven’t watched the show yet to read my recap without worrying about spoilers. However, if a plot detail is brought up in a plot synopsis such as those found on MyDramaList or AsianWiki, I figured it is not really a spoiler.

With that said, let’s get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**January**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Crowned Clown - TvN**

Historical drama about a clown becoming a body double of the king of Joseon, due to their similar appearance.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The drama is visually stunning. There is some sick editing showing the contrasts and duality of different scenes, drawing parallels between different characters and their actions. The cinematography is good enough to hold up even if they were from a movie, let alone a drama. The shots of the palace garden with its luscious greenery, ponds and bridges truly makes the palace feel as if though it is otherworldly and separate from what is outside its walls. Another great set of shots is of the marketplace at night glowing with the passion of ordinary people enjoying some worldly entertainment to grant light to their lives.

(2) Yeo Jin Goo’s acting as both Ha Seon, the clown and King Yi Heon is fantastic. This the best double role performance I have seen in all of kdrama. The way the characters act even down to the micro emotions is completely separate from one another, making them feel like distinctly different people even though they share the same actor. Despite their differences, both of the characters are equally intriguing and seeing both of them on screen at the same time is a treat. Also, seeing Ha Seon acting like and channeling King Yi Heon is very pleasing, as it is sort of a third character that Yeo Jin Goo has to play. He didn’t just copy his performance as Yi Heon; there are subtle differences between Yi Heon and Ha Seon pretending to be Yi Heon.

(3) Other than the connection to the parent story Masquerade (2012) and Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper (1881) that inspired the plot of both stories it also has other references such as Shakespeare’s tragedies and historical plays. Much of the plot and themes are straight up Shakespearean, and even specific scenes are heavily Shakespeare inspired. &gt;!The scene of the king being kept awake at night and seeing visions of the ones whom he is responsible for dying is straight out of a page from MacBeth. Just like in Macbeth, the scene carries the notion that dreams are this unnatural state in which unnatural occurrences such as murder come out to haunt you and the guilt being felt is represented by blood. This time, however, it is not the main character holding the dagger to kill the king in his bedroom, the main character is the king about to be stabbed in his bedroom. They flipped the classic story and I appreciate that. !&lt;

&gt;!Another interesting thing about the Macbeth reference is that it also stretches to Ha Seon when he becomes king. But unlike Macbeth and Lady Macbeth who physically remove the blood from their hands and clothes to try to get rid of their guilt, Ha Seon, who gets the servant girl Gye Hwan’s blood on himself through an assassination attempt on him, refuses to have anyone clean the blood off of him. This shows his righteous moral character that feels remorse for the ones who die around him unlike characters such as Macbeth, Lady Macbeth and King Yi Heon. Later on, after Ha Seon’s sister is harmed, he returns to the throne room. Now he is the one holding the sword and begging secretary Yi Kyu to symbolically teach him “the way of the sword”, straying from the once moral path he walked. From this point onwards, Ha Seon keeps walking the line between the doing the good thing and getting revenge on those who wronged him.!&lt;

&gt;!Furthermore, king Yi Heon, much like Macbeth, becomes so paranoid that he ends up visiting a cult/priests/witches who give him a foreboding prophecy about his fate. They tell him that there will be a revolt which just makes him even more paranoid, even becoming suspicious against his own allies. His own allies who once supported him then turn against and ultimately dies at the hand of someone who was his closest ally (or the successor of his closest ally in the case of Macbeth). I should point out the poetic justice that Yi Heon and his brother died in the same way by the hands of the same person as well, which was a nice touch.!&lt;

(4) Much like how Shakespeare probably have written some of the most beautiful dialogue ever, the dialogue in this drama is very beautiful. Some of the lines in the show are absolutely beautifully written, such as “Life is about regretting at night what we did in the day”. Another good one is: “‘Why would you choose to live in the smallest house at the end of the alley?’ ‘I chose it because I would be the closest to you and we would have to take the longest walk to reach it.’” Just some stellar lines. Standing ovation.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) There is a recurring problem of quite poor looking CGI fire in indoor scenes for some reason. Considering how gorgeous the series looks as a whole, the fire sometimes sticks out like a sore thumb. I would guess they weren’t allowed to use real fire inside some of the palace sets and either didn’t prioritize good looking CGI fire in the budget or the time constraints of producing the drama left some effects looking unfinished.

(2) Unlike the source material, The Prince and the Pauper, where Edward Tudor is quite a sympathetic character, even though his upbringing has been privileged, King Yi Heon is not sympathetic and doesn’t have great character development. &gt;!Edward is put in the position of the poor boy whom he switched places with and experiences the hardships of living as a poor boy with an alcoholic father and through this experience Edward develops as a character. King Yi Heon spends most of his experience of not being at the throne on drugs or in a hut where his conscience gets the better of him. Unlike Edward who vows to reign with mercy, Yi Heon never gets to redeem himself and then dies without improving himself. I suppose one could see it as Yi Heon being sacrificed for the greater good of the nation, but I still feel like his lack of character development is a weakness compared to the source material.!&lt;

(3) The writing and pacing gets a bit worse after the first half. One possible reason for this is that the first half of the drama is based on the events of the movie Masquerade, whereas the second half is written as a continuation, depicting the events taking place after the movie. Thus, in the first half they could use the movie as a frame of reference, whereas the second half lacked the opportunity to closely follow any form of source material.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,5 / 10* \- The drama is really high quality but since the writing and pacing of the story drops off a fair bit in the second half, it brings down my score from being higher.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Spring Turns to Spring - MBC**

Comedy drama about two women with very different lives switching bodies.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The CGI looks decent for a drama at least. Morphing is a technique that has been used to swap faces on different bodies in film since the early 90’s, popularized by the Terminator series, but I have no complaints of how they use it in this drama. The particle effects in the opening scene of the drama when showing how experiments are conducted are pretty solid too.

(2) The music in the show is super catchy. I haven’t had an OST hard stuck to my brain like this ever since “LOVE IS THE MOMENT!!!”. I was singing “Welcome to the Bom” and “Bomi O Na Bom Bom, Bomi O Na Bom Bom Bom” to myself for weeks after seeing this drama.

(3) The acting from most of the main cast is really enjoyable. Lee Yoori and Uhm Ji Won do a pretty good role of playing the roles of the two women who switch characters with one another and have to channel each others’ characters. You never question which character is occupying which body at any given time, it is always clear through their expressions, mannerisms and voice tone.

Choi Byung Mo is really good at playing a corrupt jerk &gt;!who sleeps with women he shouldn’t sleep with, as seen in his role in Stranger. The irony regarding a cheating husband being jealous about his wife potentially cheating is pretty amusing. Unfortunately, there are way too many delusional people in this world who think it’s fine for them to cheat even though they hate when their partner cheats and it feels like this show is poking fun at that through this running gag. Props to the writer for including these types of smarter jokes as well.!&lt;

(4) Overall, the humor is decent and while it resorts to cheap gags most of the time, it does include some jokes that go above the simple and cheap ones. Some great jokes come from the referential humor that is prevalent throughout the show. For instance, there is a nice reference to Korean movie The Outlaws (2017) with the “Let’s go to the Room of Truth”, followed by a reversal of expectation where Kim Bomi’s boss tries to get information out of her by playing “good cop” as opposed to the movie The Outlaws where going to the Room of Truth means retrieving information through the means of “bad cop” methods.

Some other funny shout outs include: “She is crazy, she has split personality disorder, but not just 2 personalities, she has 7, it’s like Kill Me, Heal Me” and “‘I was on that UFO, I came to see Cheon Song Yi.’ ‘Snap out of it Do Min Joon!’”. Overall, I would say that this is the kind of comedy drama that you need to be somewhat familiar with Korean dramas, movies and pop culture to get the most out of the jokes.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The largest issue by far is that the drama loses a lot of steam towards the back end as the writers are starting to run out of material and a lot plot points repeat themselves and some new unnecessary plot points are added without adding to the show as a whole, rather it takes away from the show. One of these plot points is the absolutely worst trope used in kdramas, &gt;!memory loss!&lt;. It happens without any prior establishing that it might happen, it just shows up one episode. &gt;!While it is certainly plausible that it could happen as a side effect of the drug and the constant body swapping, some indication of it occurring would be preferable.!&lt; This is most likely the result of not pre producing a drama where the writer is not sure of all the details from the start and is writing as the show goes along. &gt;!The memory loss also has almost no effect on the story and the characters, it is only used as a reason for why their body switching powers are revealed to the world.!&lt; Overall, the drama would have been better if they just left out this unnecessary and overused trope.

(2) The use of the chicken sounds as a sort of laugh track, as popularized in kdramas by the goat sounds from the Reply series, is just a lazy way to execute comedy. It’s pretty patronizing toward the audience to metaphorically light up a large neon sign that says: “Laugh now”. Many comedy series are guilty of using this tool, but I really appreciate when they don’t and let the comedy speak for itself.

(3) The whole set up about stepping into someone else’s shoes is about getting new perspectives and thus making a personal journey of character development. The problem, however, is that these two characters are not on a level playing field when it comes to the need of personal growth. Starting out, Lee Bom is a very pathetic character. She can be quite vile in her ignorant everything-must-be-happy-and-perfect mindset which comes of as a pretense kindness. She is supposed to be a sympathetic character &gt;!considering her husband is cheating on her!&lt;, but there really is none to be had from the viewer considering her portrayal as an oblivious housewife who just cannot stand up for herself. Meanwhile, Kim Bomi doesn’t have nearly that long of a personal journey to make. Yes, she is selfish and only has herself in mind, but she doesn’t need anything else currently as she is focusing on her career in a dog-eat-dog industry. Her only real flaw is that she takes advantage of people for her own gain, but even that is a product of her surroundings putting her in a situation where she has had to play dirty in order to rise from the bottom of society. Nevertheless, the point both of the characters reach in the end of the drama is pretty satisfying so I’ll forgive this partially.

(4) As the drama is neither spectacular or terrible there is very few scenes from it that are memorable. It stays rather average throughout. The scenery in terms of set design or filming locations is seldom anything intriguing. The events that unfold feel natural but so natural that it becomes formulaic and predictable. It’s way of dealing with tropes is rather by adopting them than breaking away from them or reversing expectations. Overall, it is an enjoyable show but not one that is going to stay on your mind for very long and I would be surprised if this show has any staying power in the drama watching community.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 6,0 / 10* \- This drama is not great, but it’s far from bad. As such, I give it an average score.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Kingdom (Season 1) - Netflix**

Historical horror drama about a zombie outbreak in Joseon.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The drama looks absolutely stunning and keeps that movie-like quality going throughout the series. The budget is insane for a kdrama as each episode is reported to have cost more than 1,78 million dollars and it really shows. (Although, believe it or not, it is not the most expensive kdrama this year counted, even when counted per episode). It looks absolutely gorgeous in terms of photography, set design, make-up and CGI.

(2) The writing is absolutely incredible. The drama is an adaption of the webtoon “Burning Hell - Land of God”, written by the screenwriter Kim Eun Hee back in 2014. For those of you unfamiliar, Kim Eun Hee wrote the acclaimed hit drama Signal (2016) and she is one of the best, if not the best, screenwriter currently active in the Korean drama industry. The premise of the show is pretty unique in that it combines the zombie apocalypse with a historical setting. Normally, I would be quite sceptical about an adaptation of such a story to the small screen. However, I can imagine having the original writer of the story central in the production process as well as a large budget backing them is partly what made this adaptation so successful. The drama tells a grim and sinister story in the best way possible as it is full of brutal, ugly and terrifying moments of death, revenge, lies and betrayal which showcases the darkest parts of the human psyche.

(3) The show gets pretty philosophical if you start looking into it as it asks us some pressing but frightening questions. Like many good monster/apocalypse movies, the show asks the viewer: who are the truly dangerous ones, the monsters or us humans? Perhaps the people in power who will do any vile action in order to stay in power are more like monsters than the actual brainless zombies feasting on any living being they come across. Not all people throughout the show view the zombies as monsters but still see them as their neighbors, their friends and family as well as fellow humans and urge for them not to be harmed. This leads us to the question: What makes us human? Consequently, it also makes us wonder: What would you do in order to survive? Would you be willing to cast aside your humanity in order to stay alive? All in all, this drama is very thought provoking all though it might not seem like it from the synopsis and genre.

(4) The action and the gore is unmatched by any other kdrama I’ve seen. It keeps you on edge and makes everything look as real as possible for a series with fantasy elements. As it is a Netflix production, they can get away with things that would not fly on prime-time Korean television and it is one of the few shows that I can think of in recent history, other than Children of Nobody, that received an age restriction higher than 15+. I suppose the gore could be a turn-off for some people but I think it is used in a fitting way and not just to be edgy or cool. It helps with world building, showing what the world has become in the apocalypse and also provides further insight to how different characters are reacting to going through these traumatic experiences since we get to see and hear the uncensored events.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) There were apparently some production issues and a couple of the production staff even died during the filming. The overworking of production teams is probably a more common occurrence than we think in the Korean entertainment industry, but it still sucks seeing something like this happen. Although it doesn’t affect the quality of the show, it is still a flaw of the production cycle as such a tragedy should have been avoided.

(2) Although the acting is very good, some of the great actors feel a little underutilized, mainly Bae Doona and Ryu Seungryong. Their characters have been a bit in the periphery of the story. I’m hoping that will get better in season 2 which seems to be happening as actor Ryu Seungryong actually said in interviews that he will have a bigger role in the upcoming season. Bae Doona received a fair bit of criticism for her tone being different than the standard saeguk tone, however, as it turns out this tone is closer to how the people outside of the nobility spoke at the time. For being her very first historical drama, I think she did just fine.

(3) Some of the horror elements are a bit cheap, such as the jump scare in the opening throne room scene in episode 1. However, some of the horror is brilliant psychological horror such as the soup scene in episode 1.

(4) There are some comic relief characters and moments thrown into the story. I personally don’t mind it but if you are looking for a dark show that is 100% devoid of any comedy, then this would be a drawback.

(5) The drama is very short, as there are only 6 episodes spanning roughly 45-60 minutes each and ends on a major cliffhanger for a season 2 that is scheduled for 28 February 2020. If you are a fan of longer stories or feel the need to watch the story in its entirety, this would be a clear drawback of the series.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 10 / 10* \- No drama or piece of medium is flawless, and if that was the requirement for a 10/10, then no drama would get 10/10. I think this drama is truly genre defining and will stand the test of time as long as season 2 doesn’t royally screw things up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Romance is a Bonus Book - TvN**

Romcom slice of life drama about a writer and a single mother who used to be a copywriter going from long time friends to lovers.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) As this drama is heavily character driven, I really enjoyed that the supporting cast got to shine brightly in this drama. They all have fleshed out characters and get a lot of air time as well. The supporting cast becomes more than just cardboard cutouts with one or two personality traits, but we learn of their journeys alongside the main characters’ story.

(2) Thanks to good characterization, writing and acting the romance between the main leads felt believable. The male lead, Eunho, doesn’t just throw himself at the female lead, Dan-i, at the first opportunity possible, despite deeply regretting letting her go in the first place. As she is his close friend, he is very cautious with his feelings in order not to ruin their friendship, but eventually succumbs to them anyway as they are just too strong. Once, the romance starts to pick up speed, their relationship feels genuine, cute and supporting and there are very few misunderstandings as they are actually capable of communicating with each other like adults.

(3) A strong focus on books and showing true love for the art of book making is displayed throughout the drama. This aspect of the drama is probably the most interesting and unique part of the drama and for that very reason, I think all the book lovers out there will appreciate it. They even shone light on poetry which is criminally overlooked by most people, although that comes from me who loves poetry. The only thing that I didn’t really like about the bookmaking aspect of the drama is that they present books as something very objective. As with all art there are many subjective aspects and that goes for books as well. Thus, when they just declare a book as absolutely good or bad without further discussion it ticks me off a bit.

(4) The way they portray the struggles of women trying to rekindle their careers after having children is commendable. They deal with the issue in a mature and profound way. It shows the consequences of always putting others before yourself and not loving yourself enough, and the journey towards accomplishing a more healthy balance in life.

(5) Although the drama has a quite generic premise, the drama is filled with elements that we haven’t seen before that much. It threw in a musical number, a silent film parody, animated illustrations for telling stories and other features you don’t see in every other drama. It also has a thematic ending for each episode in the form of a picture book. Usually dramas just end when the episode is up and then they go into the preview. The only other dramas I’ve seen that added thematic endings to each episode was My Love From The Stars and the Age of Youth series with its character interviews at the end of each episode.

(6) I actually thought the mystery subplot in the drama worked really well. I know this is might be an unpopular opinion, but here me out. The mystery remained plausible throughout and didn’t involve anything that broke the existing characterizations that had been established. On top of that the mystery subplot didn’t muck about too much with the tone of the drama. Thus, I think this subplot added to the drama as a whole instead of taking away from it.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The backstory of Dan-i has very little effect on her character and the story as a whole. Dan-i being a divorced single mother is purely used as a plot device in order to give her a reason to live with Eunho that still makes her come off as sympathetic. Her ex-husband exists merely to be a slight antagonist whom Eunho can show off his macho side towards and once he is done doing so the ex-husband is never seen again. Dan-i rarely mentions her daughter or her experiences as a mother. She facetimes her daughter once around episode 5 and then we don’t see her daughter until the last episode. This is such a waste as well since they bothered to cast a really good child actress, Lee Jiwon of Sky Castle fame, who is then not utilized at all.

(2) The premise is not very unique as it is yet another office romance where the guy is the boss and the woman is his subordinate. It’s fine to write these types of stories, but being unique isn’t going to be one of its strengths as we’ve seen plenty of these stories before. Instead, it relies on good execution which it mostly keeps up.

(3) The cinematography is just average. If the cinematography of this show was a food it would be white bread. It gets the job done just fine, but it’s very plain. The intriguing shots are few and far between one another. For example, I really dig the heavy blur they put on the backgrounds with the cityscape and all of its colorful bright lights shining behind the characters in the foreground while using a telephoto lens. It’s a cool stylistic choice to use that heavy of a focus and blur on top of using the telephoto lens, making it clear through the cinematography that it’s a character driven drama putting them as far in the foreground as possible and blurring out everything else. The poor looking shots are also few and far between each other. One shot that bothered me for example is a scene where Eunho is reminiscing about the times he waited outside of Dan-i’s house after getting drunk, and the shot has both a past version of Dan-i and Eunho in frame as well as the present day Eunho. Cool idea, poor execution, as it is so extremely obvious where the cut is where they put in Lee Jong Suk’s stand-in to look like past Eunho. On the whole, one could argue that the far from flashy cinematography fits the realism of the show, but I wish they could have spiced it up a little more.

(4) The messages that the drama is trying to send become a bit too overtly obvious at times. The reason for this is that they forego the golden rule of storytelling: “show don’t tell”. The show often tries to put a nice little ribbon upon its messages, especially towards the ending of each episode, by giving out small life lessons. I get that the show is trying to put out inspirational messages to the viewer but they end up making their points a bit too in your face. It’s like the writer didn’t have enough confidence in that the viewer would pick up on the messages because they were too subtle when in fact they were just fine from the get go and there was no need to explain further. This is a very common and easy writing mistake to make so I won’t hold it against the writer too much.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- It’s a good drama that doesn’t take too many risks and leaves some plot points hanging loose, which is what hinders it from being a great drama and not just a good one.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c2nqne/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/""&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/c49q4p/the_kdramas_of_the_first_half_of_2019_a_review/""&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my take on most of the major kdramas that started airing after January 1 and ended before July 1. To narrow down the already large number of dramas, I decided to not include any drama specials, web dramas or movies.  I will be recapping the dramas in chronological order of when they started airing. Feel free to skip around freely between dramas, as reading the entire ordeal might be a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A passionate kdrama watcher who put my all into watching as many of the bigger shows of 2019 as possible. I have studied film and literature at university in Sweden and drama at university in the UK. However, I put that aside as more of a hobby and currently I’m pursuing a teaching degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do I want to achieve?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to put my opinions out there and hopefully generate some interesting debates and discussions about the shows that have aired in the first half of 2019, as a sort of recap. I hope to inspire people to try some shows they might have otherwise dismissed. I also hope that you try to change my views on some shows I might see as lacking and critique my opinion of shows I might like. When it comes down to it, media is very subjective and most aspects of how you view it is up to personal opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small note about Scores:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know, a score on a scale from 1 to 10 is not a good way to describe a drama. However, I decided to throw in what I scored each of these dramas on MyDramaList to make it a little spicy and hopefully generate more debate. If you think a drama got an unreasonable score, feel free to tell me but please motivate why it deserves a different score. Also, the amount of numbered talking points in relation to the good and bad aspects of a drama is in no relation to the score, they are just there to make it easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small note about Spoilers:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will try to use spoiler tags wherever needed, in order for people who haven’t watched the show yet to read my recap without worrying about spoilers. However, if a plot detail is brought up in a plot synopsis such as those found on MyDramaList or AsianWiki, I figured it is not really a spoiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Crowned Clown - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical drama about a clown becoming a body double of the king of Joseon, due to their similar appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama is visually stunning. There is some sick editing showing the contrasts and duality of different scenes, drawing parallels between different characters and their actions. The cinematography is good enough to hold up even if they were from a movie, let alone a drama. The shots of the palace garden with its luscious greenery, ponds and bridges truly makes the palace feel as if though it is otherworldly and separate from what is outside its walls. Another great set of shots is of the marketplace at night glowing with the passion of ordinary people enjoying some worldly entertainment to grant light to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Yeo Jin Goo’s acting as both Ha Seon, the clown and King Yi Heon is fantastic. This the best double role performance I have seen in all of kdrama. The way the characters act even down to the micro emotions is completely separate from one another, making them feel like distinctly different people even though they share the same actor. Despite their differences, both of the characters are equally intriguing and seeing both of them on screen at the same time is a treat. Also, seeing Ha Seon acting like and channeling King Yi Heon is very pleasing, as it is sort of a third character that Yeo Jin Goo has to play. He didn’t just copy his performance as Yi Heon; there are subtle differences between Yi Heon and Ha Seon pretending to be Yi Heon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Other than the connection to the parent story Masquerade (2012) and Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper (1881) that inspired the plot of both stories it also has other references such as Shakespeare’s tragedies and historical plays. Much of the plot and themes are straight up Shakespearean, and even specific scenes are heavily Shakespeare inspired. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The scene of the king being kept awake at night and seeing visions of the ones whom he is responsible for dying is straight out of a page from MacBeth. Just like in Macbeth, the scene carries the notion that dreams are this unnatural state in which unnatural occurrences such as murder come out to haunt you and the guilt being felt is represented by blood. This time, however, it is not the main character holding the dagger to kill the king in his bedroom, the main character is the king about to be stabbed in his bedroom. They flipped the classic story and I appreciate that. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Another interesting thing about the Macbeth reference is that it also stretches to Ha Seon when he becomes king. But unlike Macbeth and Lady Macbeth who physically remove the blood from their hands and clothes to try to get rid of their guilt, Ha Seon, who gets the servant girl Gye Hwan’s blood on himself through an assassination attempt on him, refuses to have anyone clean the blood off of him. This shows his righteous moral character that feels remorse for the ones who die around him unlike characters such as Macbeth, Lady Macbeth and King Yi Heon. Later on, after Ha Seon’s sister is harmed, he returns to the throne room. Now he is the one holding the sword and begging secretary Yi Kyu to symbolically teach him “the way of the sword”, straying from the once moral path he walked. From this point onwards, Ha Seon keeps walking the line between the doing the good thing and getting revenge on those who wronged him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Furthermore, king Yi Heon, much like Macbeth, becomes so paranoid that he ends up visiting a cult/priests/witches who give him a foreboding prophecy about his fate. They tell him that there will be a revolt which just makes him even more paranoid, even becoming suspicious against his own allies. His own allies who once supported him then turn against and ultimately dies at the hand of someone who was his closest ally (or the successor of his closest ally in the case of Macbeth). I should point out the poetic justice that Yi Heon and his brother died in the same way by the hands of the same person as well, which was a nice touch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Much like how Shakespeare probably have written some of the most beautiful dialogue ever, the dialogue in this drama is very beautiful. Some of the lines in the show are absolutely beautifully written, such as “Life is about regretting at night what we did in the day”. Another good one is: “‘Why would you choose to live in the smallest house at the end of the alley?’ ‘I chose it because I would be the closest to you and we would have to take the longest walk to reach it.’” Just some stellar lines. Standing ovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There is a recurring problem of quite poor looking CGI fire in indoor scenes for some reason. Considering how gorgeous the series looks as a whole, the fire sometimes sticks out like a sore thumb. I would guess they weren’t allowed to use real fire inside some of the palace sets and either didn’t prioritize good looking CGI fire in the budget or the time constraints of producing the drama left some effects looking unfinished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Unlike the source material, The Prince and the Pauper, where Edward Tudor is quite a sympathetic character, even though his upbringing has been privileged, King Yi Heon is not sympathetic and doesn’t have great character development. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Edward is put in the position of the poor boy whom he switched places with and experiences the hardships of living as a poor boy with an alcoholic father and through this experience Edward develops as a character. King Yi Heon spends most of his experience of not being at the throne on drugs or in a hut where his conscience gets the better of him. Unlike Edward who vows to reign with mercy, Yi Heon never gets to redeem himself and then dies without improving himself. I suppose one could see it as Yi Heon being sacrificed for the greater good of the nation, but I still feel like his lack of character development is a weakness compared to the source material.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The writing and pacing gets a bit worse after the first half. One possible reason for this is that the first half of the drama is based on the events of the movie Masquerade, whereas the second half is written as a continuation, depicting the events taking place after the movie. Thus, in the first half they could use the movie as a frame of reference, whereas the second half lacked the opportunity to closely follow any form of source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The drama is really high quality but since the writing and pacing of the story drops off a fair bit in the second half, it brings down my score from being higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spring Turns to Spring - MBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comedy drama about two women with very different lives switching bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The CGI looks decent for a drama at least. Morphing is a technique that has been used to swap faces on different bodies in film since the early 90’s, popularized by the Terminator series, but I have no complaints of how they use it in this drama. The particle effects in the opening scene of the drama when showing how experiments are conducted are pretty solid too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The music in the show is super catchy. I haven’t had an OST hard stuck to my brain like this ever since “LOVE IS THE MOMENT!!!”. I was singing “Welcome to the Bom” and “Bomi O Na Bom Bom, Bomi O Na Bom Bom Bom” to myself for weeks after seeing this drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The acting from most of the main cast is really enjoyable. Lee Yoori and Uhm Ji Won do a pretty good role of playing the roles of the two women who switch characters with one another and have to channel each others’ characters. You never question which character is occupying which body at any given time, it is always clear through their expressions, mannerisms and voice tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choi Byung Mo is really good at playing a corrupt jerk &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;who sleeps with women he shouldn’t sleep with, as seen in his role in Stranger. The irony regarding a cheating husband being jealous about his wife potentially cheating is pretty amusing. Unfortunately, there are way too many delusional people in this world who think it’s fine for them to cheat even though they hate when their partner cheats and it feels like this show is poking fun at that through this running gag. Props to the writer for including these types of smarter jokes as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Overall, the humor is decent and while it resorts to cheap gags most of the time, it does include some jokes that go above the simple and cheap ones. Some great jokes come from the referential humor that is prevalent throughout the show. For instance, there is a nice reference to Korean movie The Outlaws (2017) with the “Let’s go to the Room of Truth”, followed by a reversal of expectation where Kim Bomi’s boss tries to get information out of her by playing “good cop” as opposed to the movie The Outlaws where going to the Room of Truth means retrieving information through the means of “bad cop” methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some other funny shout outs include: “She is crazy, she has split personality disorder, but not just 2 personalities, she has 7, it’s like Kill Me, Heal Me” and “‘I was on that UFO, I came to see Cheon Song Yi.’ ‘Snap out of it Do Min Joon!’”. Overall, I would say that this is the kind of comedy drama that you need to be somewhat familiar with Korean dramas, movies and pop culture to get the most out of the jokes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The largest issue by far is that the drama loses a lot of steam towards the back end as the writers are starting to run out of material and a lot plot points repeat themselves and some new unnecessary plot points are added without adding to the show as a whole, rather it takes away from the show. One of these plot points is the absolutely worst trope used in kdramas, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;memory loss&lt;/span&gt;. It happens without any prior establishing that it might happen, it just shows up one episode. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;While it is certainly plausible that it could happen as a side effect of the drug and the constant body swapping, some indication of it occurring would be preferable.&lt;/span&gt; This is most likely the result of not pre producing a drama where the writer is not sure of all the details from the start and is writing as the show goes along. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The memory loss also has almost no effect on the story and the characters, it is only used as a reason for why their body switching powers are revealed to the world.&lt;/span&gt; Overall, the drama would have been better if they just left out this unnecessary and overused trope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The use of the chicken sounds as a sort of laugh track, as popularized in kdramas by the goat sounds from the Reply series, is just a lazy way to execute comedy. It’s pretty patronizing toward the audience to metaphorically light up a large neon sign that says: “Laugh now”. Many comedy series are guilty of using this tool, but I really appreciate when they don’t and let the comedy speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The whole set up about stepping into someone else’s shoes is about getting new perspectives and thus making a personal journey of character development. The problem, however, is that these two characters are not on a level playing field when it comes to the need of personal growth. Starting out, Lee Bom is a very pathetic character. She can be quite vile in her ignorant everything-must-be-happy-and-perfect mindset which comes of as a pretense kindness. She is supposed to be a sympathetic character &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;considering her husband is cheating on her&lt;/span&gt;, but there really is none to be had from the viewer considering her portrayal as an oblivious housewife who just cannot stand up for herself. Meanwhile, Kim Bomi doesn’t have nearly that long of a personal journey to make. Yes, she is selfish and only has herself in mind, but she doesn’t need anything else currently as she is focusing on her career in a dog-eat-dog industry. Her only real flaw is that she takes advantage of people for her own gain, but even that is a product of her surroundings putting her in a situation where she has had to play dirty in order to rise from the bottom of society. Nevertheless, the point both of the characters reach in the end of the drama is pretty satisfying so I’ll forgive this partially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) As the drama is neither spectacular or terrible there is very few scenes from it that are memorable. It stays rather average throughout. The scenery in terms of set design or filming locations is seldom anything intriguing. The events that unfold feel natural but so natural that it becomes formulaic and predictable. It’s way of dealing with tropes is rather by adopting them than breaking away from them or reversing expectations. Overall, it is an enjoyable show but not one that is going to stay on your mind for very long and I would be surprised if this show has any staying power in the drama watching community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 6,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama is not great, but it’s far from bad. As such, I give it an average score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingdom (Season 1) - Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historical horror drama about a zombie outbreak in Joseon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama looks absolutely stunning and keeps that movie-like quality going throughout the series. The budget is insane for a kdrama as each episode is reported to have cost more than 1,78 million dollars and it really shows. (Although, believe it or not, it is not the most expensive kdrama this year counted, even when counted per episode). It looks absolutely gorgeous in terms of photography, set design, make-up and CGI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The writing is absolutely incredible. The drama is an adaption of the webtoon “Burning Hell - Land of God”, written by the screenwriter Kim Eun Hee back in 2014. For those of you unfamiliar, Kim Eun Hee wrote the acclaimed hit drama Signal (2016) and she is one of the best, if not the best, screenwriter currently active in the Korean drama industry. The premise of the show is pretty unique in that it combines the zombie apocalypse with a historical setting. Normally, I would be quite sceptical about an adaptation of such a story to the small screen. However, I can imagine having the original writer of the story central in the production process as well as a large budget backing them is partly what made this adaptation so successful. The drama tells a grim and sinister story in the best way possible as it is full of brutal, ugly and terrifying moments of death, revenge, lies and betrayal which showcases the darkest parts of the human psyche.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The show gets pretty philosophical if you start looking into it as it asks us some pressing but frightening questions. Like many good monster/apocalypse movies, the show asks the viewer: who are the truly dangerous ones, the monsters or us humans? Perhaps the people in power who will do any vile action in order to stay in power are more like monsters than the actual brainless zombies feasting on any living being they come across. Not all people throughout the show view the zombies as monsters but still see them as their neighbors, their friends and family as well as fellow humans and urge for them not to be harmed. This leads us to the question: What makes us human? Consequently, it also makes us wonder: What would you do in order to survive? Would you be willing to cast aside your humanity in order to stay alive? All in all, this drama is very thought provoking all though it might not seem like it from the synopsis and genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The action and the gore is unmatched by any other kdrama I’ve seen. It keeps you on edge and makes everything look as real as possible for a series with fantasy elements. As it is a Netflix production, they can get away with things that would not fly on prime-time Korean television and it is one of the few shows that I can think of in recent history, other than Children of Nobody, that received an age restriction higher than 15+. I suppose the gore could be a turn-off for some people but I think it is used in a fitting way and not just to be edgy or cool. It helps with world building, showing what the world has become in the apocalypse and also provides further insight to how different characters are reacting to going through these traumatic experiences since we get to see and hear the uncensored events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There were apparently some production issues and a couple of the production staff even died during the filming. The overworking of production teams is probably a more common occurrence than we think in the Korean entertainment industry, but it still sucks seeing something like this happen. Although it doesn’t affect the quality of the show, it is still a flaw of the production cycle as such a tragedy should have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Although the acting is very good, some of the great actors feel a little underutilized, mainly Bae Doona and Ryu Seungryong. Their characters have been a bit in the periphery of the story. I’m hoping that will get better in season 2 which seems to be happening as actor Ryu Seungryong actually said in interviews that he will have a bigger role in the upcoming season. Bae Doona received a fair bit of criticism for her tone being different than the standard saeguk tone, however, as it turns out this tone is closer to how the people outside of the nobility spoke at the time. For being her very first historical drama, I think she did just fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some of the horror elements are a bit cheap, such as the jump scare in the opening throne room scene in episode 1. However, some of the horror is brilliant psychological horror such as the soup scene in episode 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some comic relief characters and moments thrown into the story. I personally don’t mind it but if you are looking for a dark show that is 100% devoid of any comedy, then this would be a drawback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The drama is very short, as there are only 6 episodes spanning roughly 45-60 minutes each and ends on a major cliffhanger for a season 2 that is scheduled for 28 February 2020. If you are a fan of longer stories or feel the need to watch the story in its entirety, this would be a clear drawback of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 10 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - No drama or piece of medium is flawless, and if that was the requirement for a 10/10, then no drama would get 10/10. I think this drama is truly genre defining and will stand the test of time as long as season 2 doesn’t royally screw things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Romance is a Bonus Book - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romcom slice of life drama about a writer and a single mother who used to be a copywriter going from long time friends to lovers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) As this drama is heavily character driven, I really enjoyed that the supporting cast got to shine brightly in this drama. They all have fleshed out characters and get a lot of air time as well. The supporting cast becomes more than just cardboard cutouts with one or two personality traits, but we learn of their journeys alongside the main characters’ story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Thanks to good characterization, writing and acting the romance between the main leads felt believable. The male lead, Eunho, doesn’t just throw himself at the female lead, Dan-i, at the first opportunity possible, despite deeply regretting letting her go in the first place. As she is his close friend, he is very cautious with his feelings in order not to ruin their friendship, but eventually succumbs to them anyway as they are just too strong. Once, the romance starts to pick up speed, their relationship feels genuine, cute and supporting and there are very few misunderstandings as they are actually capable of communicating with each other like adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) A strong focus on books and showing true love for the art of book making is displayed throughout the drama. This aspect of the drama is probably the most interesting and unique part of the drama and for that very reason, I think all the book lovers out there will appreciate it. They even shone light on poetry which is criminally overlooked by most people, although that comes from me who loves poetry. The only thing that I didn’t really like about the bookmaking aspect of the drama is that they present books as something very objective. As with all art there are many subjective aspects and that goes for books as well. Thus, when they just declare a book as absolutely good or bad without further discussion it ticks me off a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The way they portray the struggles of women trying to rekindle their careers after having children is commendable. They deal with the issue in a mature and profound way. It shows the consequences of always putting others before yourself and not loving yourself enough, and the journey towards accomplishing a more healthy balance in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Although the drama has a quite generic premise, the drama is filled with elements that we haven’t seen before that much. It threw in a musical number, a silent film parody, animated illustrations for telling stories and other features you don’t see in every other drama. It also has a thematic ending for each episode in the form of a picture book. Usually dramas just end when the episode is up and then they go into the preview. The only other dramas I’ve seen that added thematic endings to each episode was My Love From The Stars and the Age of Youth series with its character interviews at the end of each episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) I actually thought the mystery subplot in the drama worked really well. I know this is might be an unpopular opinion, but here me out. The mystery remained plausible throughout and didn’t involve anything that broke the existing characterizations that had been established. On top of that the mystery subplot didn’t muck about too much with the tone of the drama. Thus, I think this subplot added to the drama as a whole instead of taking away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The backstory of Dan-i has very little effect on her character and the story as a whole. Dan-i being a divorced single mother is purely used as a plot device in order to give her a reason to live with Eunho that still makes her come off as sympathetic. Her ex-husband exists merely to be a slight antagonist whom Eunho can show off his macho side towards and once he is done doing so the ex-husband is never seen again. Dan-i rarely mentions her daughter or her experiences as a mother. She facetimes her daughter once around episode 5 and then we don’t see her daughter until the last episode. This is such a waste as well since they bothered to cast a really good child actress, Lee Jiwon of Sky Castle fame, who is then not utilized at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The premise is not very unique as it is yet another office romance where the guy is the boss and the woman is his subordinate. It’s fine to write these types of stories, but being unique isn’t going to be one of its strengths as we’ve seen plenty of these stories before. Instead, it relies on good execution which it mostly keeps up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The cinematography is just average. If the cinematography of this show was a food it would be white bread. It gets the job done just fine, but it’s very plain. The intriguing shots are few and far between one another. For example, I really dig the heavy blur they put on the backgrounds with the cityscape and all of its colorful bright lights shining behind the characters in the foreground while using a telephoto lens. It’s a cool stylistic choice to use that heavy of a focus and blur on top of using the telephoto lens, making it clear through the cinematography that it’s a character driven drama putting them as far in the foreground as possible and blurring out everything else. The poor looking shots are also few and far between each other. One shot that bothered me for example is a scene where Eunho is reminiscing about the times he waited outside of Dan-i’s house after getting drunk, and the shot has both a past version of Dan-i and Eunho in frame as well as the present day Eunho. Cool idea, poor execution, as it is so extremely obvious where the cut is where they put in Lee Jong Suk’s stand-in to look like past Eunho. On the whole, one could argue that the far from flashy cinematography fits the realism of the show, but I wish they could have spiced it up a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The messages that the drama is trying to send become a bit too overtly obvious at times. The reason for this is that they forego the golden rule of storytelling: “show don’t tell”. The show often tries to put a nice little ribbon upon its messages, especially towards the ending of each episode, by giving out small life lessons. I get that the show is trying to put out inspirational messages to the viewer but they end up making their points a bit too in your face. It’s like the writer didn’t have enough confidence in that the viewer would pick up on the messages because they were too subtle when in fact they were just fine from the get go and there was no need to explain further. This is a very common and easy writing mistake to make so I won’t hold it against the writer too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a good drama that doesn’t take too many risks and leaves some plot points hanging loose, which is what hinders it from being a great drama and not just a good one.&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office""&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/a&gt; episodes 4 - 5.

If you’ve been around the sub awhile you will totally recognise the pattern of repeating posts we see on the regular. For your reading pleasure we have included links to some of our absolute favourite representations of the kind of posts we’d love to see more of on the sub.

[THE RARE AND THE BEAUTIFUL “HIGH QUALITY” POSTS ](https://imgur.com/2vkfKmU)

*Generally drowned out in a sea of low quality posts, if you manage to find one it’s your lucky day!*

* **High quality, high effort troll posts** but also kinda serious such as [u/AlohaAlex](https://www.reddit.com/u/AlohaAlex/)’s glorious and excellently titled [A Weirdly Specific Brief History of Saguek Hats](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/8nmay9/a_weirdly_specific_brief_history_of_sageuk_hats/) well deserving of its gold status despite the clear and apparent lack of Lee Seung Gi imagery. We look forward to his high quality take on shoes through the ages/hanbok designs and the deep meanings behind them. *You’ve set the bar high, my friend. Your fans are clamouring for more! No pressure \^\^*
* Our **“ultimate shitpost”** [r/KDRAMA FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/7yby12/the_real_answers_to_some_frequently_asked/)  is a more tongue in cheek example of this and we will link it at any opportune moment in an attempt to increase the quality of your life. BEWARE mentioning *Descendants of the Sun* will trigger it in 95% of cases (*Goblin* *and Boys Over Flo*wers the other 5% respectively).
* **Simple questions that** we all wondered about but were too embarrassed to ask which then **lead to excellent well researched discussions** as the people who already Googled the same thing and Googled it well. [Such as this fine discussion of visual censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6djxz9/visual_censorship/), or this [discussion about why characters always use bottled water](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/7cke2m/why_do_they_always_drink_water_from_a_bottle/).
* **Well researched, informative posts** such as [u/PumpkinSpice210](https://www.reddit.com/u/PumpkinSpice210/)’s post on The [Hwaseong Serial Murders](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6wsqcx/the_hwaseong_serial_murders/), [u/thatkoreanunni](https://www.reddit.com/u/thatkoreanunni/)’s[ blog on what you might be missing when simply reading the subtitles during Goblin](https://thatkoreanunni.tumblr.com/post/162483048711/goblin-ep-2) and u/michkdl's website's series on the books featured in *Romance is a Bonus Book* \- [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/b4knbu/heres_part_1_of_the_books_featured_in_romance_is/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/bji4ny/heres_part_2_of_the_books_featured_in_romance_is/) (we can't wait for the final part).
* **Entertaining reviews** such as [this hilarious take on W](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6b0qii/just_finished_my_boyfriend_is_a_cartoon_i_mean_w/) by [u/eroverton](https://www.reddit.com/u/eroverton/) WE MISS YOU! \*cries\*  which lead to high quality discussion and further interest in said drama and reviews  that convince you that you should have started that drama yesterday despite your inability to watch multiple historical dramas simultaneously, such as u/GSV_Zero_Gravitas' [Haechi appreciation post](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/bnalns/haechi_appreciation_spoiler_free/).

&amp;#x200B;

[MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POSTS](https://imgur.com/vw2Nmbb) (literally any excuse for an image of our bae JKH &lt;3)

*Depending on the content of the comments these can go either way, just like wandering through traffic (you could get hit by a car and die or you  survive and value your life more, admittedly it’s not the best analogy..)*

* **Automod/mod posts** \- Monday Madness/I’m watching too many dramas Wednesday/Thursday Rules post ~~no one reads~~/Weekend Whatevs. The mod squad ([u/life-finds-a-way](https://www.reddit.com/u/life-finds-a-way/) and [u/Jackall8](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jackall8/)) post important updates/rules from time to time - they are usually stickied.
* **Organised drama discussions** \- On air / Weekly Binge - don’t be scared to write more than “I am loving this drama”. Increase the quality of the discussion and tell us why!
* **More in depth questions** that may or may not lead to good discussions i.e. more than two sentences, generally well punctuated.
* **Fun and games** \- someone gets inspired and tries to do something fun such as the time u/the-other-otter ~~judged us all for eating lemons~~ [quizzed us on which member of Heirs we were](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/aw68xk/i_made_a_personality_test_who_are_you_in_heirs/) or when [u/horatioe](https://www.reddit.com/u/horatioe/) [made us question if we loved any actor more than Jung Kyung Ho](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/8dj2xc/favorite_korean_actor_bracket_challenge/) ^(we love him and his eyebags very much in case you were wondering..)
* **Self promotion** some people do some pretty high quality stuff when inspired by dramas like [u/starwarspunk](https://www.reddit.com/u/starwarspunk/) who [designs amazing cross stitch patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/8p6s9i/secret_garden_kdrama_cross_stitch/). Meanwhile, we admit to our low quality that just can't touch HSJ and just get inspired to [make and eat delicious food](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/aeshx4/cooking_along_with_the_fun_cooking_bot_or_the_day/) and [spend all of our money on things we definitely don’t need](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/a9dw2i/boyfriend_and_i_both_got_each_other_kloot_for/). Like [u/MerinoMedia](https://www.reddit.com/u/MerinoMedia/)’s [adorable plushie](https://imgur.com/bBKb0Gk) she totally didn’t need cause she didn’t even like the drama all that much but when has that ever stopped anyone?!

&amp;#x200B;

[LOW QUALITY POSTS ](https://imgur.com/yoGtG03)

*Generally one or two sentences in length, if that, sometimes lead to good discussions.*

* *Is it just me?* (no, it's not) And other **opinion type posts**  \- asking people what they thought about a drama without opening up  about their own feelings. Long run on sentences on how this drama was the best thing ever and it made them feel a thousand feelings and cry a  thousand tears and how there will never be a drama that will ever be  this good and now they can’t watch another drama because it won’t  compare HOW DO THEY MOVE ON FROM THIS DRAMA SOMEONE HELP THIS POOR  PERSON (Actually we do have an answer for this. We won’t give it to you  though. You can find it in the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/7yby12/the_real_answers_to_some_frequently_asked/))
* **Simple questions** \- AKA when writing out a post on [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/)  is apparently faster than Google &gt;\_&gt;. You probably could have  looked in the sidebar/wiki/searched previous posts/Googled/Shazamed that and found the answer. If you have done all that and still don’t know the answer [read the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/rules) and work out the appropriate place to post it.
* Linking things from **other sources**  \- Articles/OST track/trailers (bring the HYPE) and listicles that don’t generate much conversation. Sometimes really interesting links are shared such as when [u/Jackall8](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jackall8/) shared [this guide to South Korean Censorship](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6m8sqn/a_guide_to_south_korean_censorship/). While it is not a rule of [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/)  that you need to lead a discussion on said posts if they fulfil the  rule requirements, it would be nice to know why you thought people would  be interested in said article.
* **Let's make a list** of this kind of dramas and not explain why they are listed, discussion is overrated anyway. Once upon a time you probably thought this would be  helpful or would bring discussion on said listed dramas. Sorry. Nope.  Maybe try [r/kdramarecommends](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/)? We’re big fans of lists there.

&amp;#x200B;

[ILLEGAL RULE BREAKING POSTS  ](https://imgur.com/KMinRc9)

*If you don’t get \[removed\] by the mod squad it’s probably because you are a meme and got 100 upvotes already..*

* **Meme without discussion prompt** … [AKA the most popular posts in the history of r/KDRAMA if you search](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/top/?t=all) ^(Yes, some of these have prompts.) If you can’t think of a discussion prompt, post it in Monday Madness/The Weekend Wrap-Up or attempt to bring r/kfunny to the high quality shitpost status that it deserves*.* It’s so ded there and that’s just not fair to the universe.
* **Secret recommendation request** \*triggered\* Congrats on sneaking it past automod but it has probably been asked before on [r/kdramarecommends](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/)…  twice this week. This is not to be confused with “let’s make a list” posts, which are usually well meaning and interested in knowing more about a particular genre but really should be posted in [r/kdramarecommends](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/) as well.
* **Off topic posts**  WTF does that even have to do with KDRAMA?! Off-topic goes in Monday Madness/Weekend discussion posts or on a totally different sub-reddit.
* **Blatant spoilers** \-[ Can you not?](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags)

Thank you to our wonderful mods and everyone who does their bit to increase the quality of [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/)! &lt;3

Like &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/MerinoMedia/""&gt;u/MerinoMedia&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/bBKb0Gk""&gt;adorable plushie&lt;/a&gt; she totally didn’t need cause she didn’t even like the drama all that much but when has that ever stopped anyone?!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/yoGtG03""&gt;LOW QUALITY POSTS &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generally one or two sentences in length, if that, sometimes lead to good discussions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it just me?&lt;/em&gt; (no, it&amp;#39;s not) And other &lt;strong&gt;opinion type posts&lt;/strong&gt;  - asking people what they thought about a drama without opening up  about their own feelings. Long run on sentences on how this drama was the best thing ever and it made them feel a thousand feelings and cry a  thousand tears and how there will never be a drama that will ever be  this good and now they can’t watch another drama because it won’t  compare HOW DO THEY MOVE ON FROM THIS DRAMA SOMEONE HELP THIS POOR  PERSON (Actually we do have an answer for this. We won’t give it to you  though. You can find it in the &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/7yby12/the_real_answers_to_some_frequently_asked/""&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple questions&lt;/strong&gt; - AKA when writing out a post on &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt;  is apparently faster than Google &amp;gt;_&amp;gt;. You probably could have  looked in the sidebar/wiki/searched previous posts/Googled/Shazamed that and found the answer. If you have done all that and still don’t know the answer &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/rules""&gt;read the rules&lt;/a&gt; and work out the appropriate place to post it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linking things from &lt;strong&gt;other sources&lt;/strong&gt;  - Articles/OST track/trailers (bring the HYPE) and listicles that don’t generate much conversation. Sometimes really interesting links are shared such as when &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/Jackall8/""&gt;u/Jackall8&lt;/a&gt; shared &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/6m8sqn/a_guide_to_south_korean_censorship/""&gt;this guide to South Korean Censorship&lt;/a&gt;. While it is not a rule of &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt;  that you need to lead a discussion on said posts if they fulfil the  rule requirements, it would be nice to know why you thought people would  be interested in said article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s make a list&lt;/strong&gt; of this kind of dramas and not explain why they are listed, discussion is overrated anyway. Once upon a time you probably thought this would be  helpful or would bring discussion on said listed dramas. Sorry. Nope.  Maybe try &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/""&gt;r/kdramarecommends&lt;/a&gt;? We’re big fans of lists there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/KMinRc9""&gt;ILLEGAL RULE BREAKING POSTS  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you don’t get [removed] by the mod squad it’s probably because you are a meme and got 100 upvotes already..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meme without discussion prompt&lt;/strong&gt; … &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/top/?t=all""&gt;AKA the most popular posts in the history of r/KDRAMA if you search&lt;/a&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Yes, some of these have prompts.&lt;/sup&gt; If you can’t think of a discussion prompt, post it in Monday Madness/The Weekend Wrap-Up or attempt to bring &lt;a href=""/r/kfunny""&gt;r/kfunny&lt;/a&gt; to the high quality shitpost status that it deserves&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It’s so ded there and that’s just not fair to the universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret recommendation request&lt;/strong&gt; *triggered* Congrats on sneaking it past automod but it has probably been asked before on &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/""&gt;r/kdramarecommends&lt;/a&gt;…  twice this week. This is not to be confused with “let’s make a list” posts, which are usually well meaning and interested in knowing more about a particular genre but really should be posted in &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdramarecommends/""&gt;r/kdramarecommends&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Off topic posts&lt;/strong&gt;  WTF does that even have to do with KDRAMA?! Off-topic goes in Monday Madness/Weekend discussion posts or on a totally different sub-reddit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blatant spoilers&lt;/strong&gt; -&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags""&gt; Can you not?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to our wonderful mods and everyone who does their bit to increase the quality of &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt;! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post brought to you with hope of a future in which high quality posts become more frequent by** &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/wrlddmntr/""&gt;u/wrlddmntr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/pvtshame/""&gt;u/pvtshame&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/MerinoMedia/""&gt;u/MerinoMedia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""/u/the-other-otter""&gt;u/the-other-otter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/AlohaAlex/""&gt;u/AlohaAlex&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/u/sianiam/""&gt;u/sianiam&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Why yes &lt;em&gt;Drinking Solo&lt;/em&gt; did change our vocabulary long term, we continue to abuse the word “quality” as per Professor Jin’s life philosophy dictates we should.&lt;/p&gt;

I have also come across shipping threads for Turkish drama couples.  But since I have been watching a lot of K-dramas lately, I have realized that there are some avid shipper threads for certain K-drama couples.  

Needless to say, shippers are mostly women.  Shipper threads can be fun, but there are some shippers who are so intense that they get extremely nasty and trash the drama as well as the actor paired opposite to one member of their “ship”.  This behavior really annoys me. 

I wonder why do shippers care so much? Is it a means of personal validation?  What happens ‘IF’ the ship really sails?  

Korean celebrities are very reserved about their personal lives and rarely participate in public displays of affection.  Take for example the Song-Song couple.  We know they are married and make a lovely couple.  But they hardly make public appearances together, rarely post couple pics in social media, and I’m not sure if they will ever co-star in a drama or movie.  So what gratification did the shippers get from the knowledge that the couple they shipped indeed were in love and got married?

I also feel that the actors really tease their fans.  Recently I watched ‘Her Private Life’ and I thought the leads had excellent chemistry.  Cheers to both Park Min Young and Kim Jae Wook for their amazing acting. The BTS videos were so much fun as well.  PMY and KJW seemed to get along like a house on fire.  I can see why fans would start “shipping” this couple.  

I noticed that up until HPL was on-air, PMY-KJW seemed to be head-over-heels in love, especially in the BTS clips.  As soon as the drama ended, they behaved like strangers. I noticed the same trend in Healer BTS as well.  PMY and Ji Chang Wook were so cozy that it would make your insides melt. In fact, JCW is also shipped with Yoona and Nam Ji Hyun, his other co-stars.  PMY’s other co-star Park Seo Joon is also shipped with his previous co-star KJW.  

It’s very easy to blame the fans for being deluded.  But are the actors completely blameless?  Is all the “friendliness” on set so very innocent? I feel that actors intentionally flirt on camera to ‘seduce’ their fans.  I’m not saying that co-actors cannot be good friends or can’t fall in love, but why fake it?  Is it really necessary?  I find it a little deceitful to pretend to be “in-love” even off-camera just to hook viewers.

Welcome to the first Weekly Binge discussion of [Radiant Office](https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office) episodes 1 -  3. On Sunday we will discuss episodes 4 &amp; 5 of the drama.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the schedule for the upcoming discussions:

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONGRATULATIONS YOU HAVE PASSED THE SCREENING PROCESS.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Picked up *The Crowned Clown* about a week ago. I've been rather busy with graduation preparations, but since the moment that I started this show, it became a psychological ordeal to get myself to stop.

I cannot get over the quality of this drama. As someone who oddly enjoys watching the deceit that goes on in Chinese palace dramas but is frequently pained by their episode counts, I was ecstatic with *The Crowned Clown*. Ironically, it could've had way more episodes and I most likely would have enjoyed it even more. I would've loved to see what the writers could have done with an extended episode count so they could get into the nitty gritty of more palace trickery. The plot wasn't the most intricate, but I found it to be a superb balance between the cruelty of the royal palace and romantic idealism. I'm so glad I didn't watch this while it was airing. The cliffhangers would've been impossible to bear.

I wasn't too happy with the ending. When Ha Seon was ""assassinated,"" I thought that would be such an awesomely tragic way to wrap up the entire story. But then they pulled the time skip card—by far one of my least favorite techniques to end any television show. It didn't seem necessary by any means and I was perplexed by it.

But even as weak as the ending was, I still love this drama. The production quality is amazing. That's not unusual for tvN, but I have a weak spot for historical sets and clothing. I spent a lot of the time admiring the scenery and really, *really* wanting to touch their clothes. The acting was phenomenal and took the story to the next level.

I was initially wary of Yeo Jin Goo taking on what seemed to be an incredibly demanding role: the only real impression I had of him was from *Moon Embracing the Sun*, which I watched with my parents waaaay back when it first came out (I'm also watching *Absolute Boyfriend,* but so far it hasn't been representative of his skill at all). I was happy to have all my doubts kicked to the curb. Within the first episode, I was hooked, but he only got more impressive with each episode. I loved Ha Seon's warmth and character development, and I feared and pitied Lee Heon. I was especially stunned at how phenomenal YJG was at depicting Ha Seon pretending to be Lee Heon. There was that one scene in particular, where Ha Seon catches the court lady checking the scar on his body and is enraged, almost like the real king, but his mannerisms are indeed that of a clown playing a part. ~~Also he was extremely attractive~~ I was in awe with that scene for a while afterward! I could go on and on, but a good way to sum up my thoughts is that [I can't wait for every drama that he will take part in from now on](https://i.redd.it/vud79ngfasly.jpg).

With every drama, I usually end up nitpicking about at least one supporting actor having poor acting and/or being victim to a badly written character. I had no protests throughout this entire drama. Lee Se Young was excellent as a calm yet decisive queen and I had zero qualms with the romance. That was a pleasant surprise; when it comes to palace dramas, I usually find the romance to be blatantly unrealistic or just plain misery-inducing. But I have to say that Kim Sang Kyung stole my heart, and unexpectedly so. I initially hated Hak San for ruining Ha Seon's life by bringing him into the palace, but learned to love his levelheaded intelligence and unwavering loyalty to his country and Ha Seon. His friendship/mentor-mentee relationship with Ha Seon was amazing to see unfold. The way that they mutually learned from and grew with one another touched my heart. While I initially predicted that one of them would be dead by the end of the series, I still bawled when Hak San died.

Whew. My emotions are still raw and my heart aches from the emptiness that finishing this drama has left behind, so I feel better writing about it. And I'd love to discuss more about it or other similar shows. For now, I'm searching for another drama to temporarily patch up this void; though I'll probably end up on a hunt for all the sageuks I lay eyes on...","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Includes major spoilers]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing would make me happier than you lovely people taking some time out of your day to check those posts out when they are published. For those uninitiated, a haiku is a Japanese poem structure, where the first line has 5 syllables, the second line has 7 syllables and the last line has 5 syllables. Of course, these are all just for laughs and giggles and meant to be taken as a joke.

Good thing there’s rewind","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m putting this lighter fun post out there as sort of a teaser for the review series that I will be posting exclusively here on &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; starting in exactly one week. The series will be divided into 5 parts and each part will correspond to the different month categories I divided the dramas into in this post and will include all the dramas that are in this post. Nothing would make me happier than you lovely people taking some time out of your day to check those posts out when they are published. For those uninitiated, a haiku is a Japanese poem structure, where the first line has 5 syllables, the second line has 7 syllables and the last line has 5 syllables. Of course, these are all just for laughs and giggles and meant to be taken as a joke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feel free to post your own kdrama haikus (doesn&amp;#39;t have to be about 2019 dramas) in the comments! Let&amp;#39;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

Like what did you think of the characters, soundtrack, story, etc...

While I liked it for the most part, i still have a lot of problems with it. Some of them are the multiple instances of extreme violence, bullying, and extreme narcisism on the part of the main male characters. I personally prefer the Japanese version because it was superior in terms of chemistry between the leads, and I thought they were much more charming and likeable.
Idk, if it hadn't been my first kdrama ever, I dont think I would have gotten so hooked on it. There are so many things I hated. I thought some of the characters where awful beyond redemption, and the bullying that went on in the first few episodes was so extreme, and while Jun Pyo did change his ways, he never really did own up to his previous actions or properly apologize. He also flip flopped so much throughout the show which didn't help his case. And there was also that bit where he was basically forcing her to fall in love with him and acting irrational when she doesn't come to him. I felt like a lot of the problems they had or the hurt they experienced could have been fixed with proper communication. Like instead of ghosting her and acting cold when he left the country, he could have told Jan Di what happened because of his mom. It would have hurt her but at least she wouldnt think that he was playing her the entire time like he made her think. Then they go back to liking each other for some time, and then they flip flop again, due to crappy communication. 

A lot of people got their first case of second lead syndrome in the drama. This is because of the total lack of chemistry between Jun Pyo and Jan Di. I dont even think it was because Ji hoo was nicer, in fact, I thought he was colder than Jun Pyo at times. I thought Jun Pyo was the one who poured his heart out to Jan Di, but they just dont belong together. They don't match to me. I just feel this aura of awkwardness whenever they are together. Like you just know they're only kissing because its in the script, y'know? I also didn't like Jan di all that much. I thought she was hella goofy, and not in a cute or charming way, especially in the beginning, and overly dramatic, but then I missed that side of her when she became a complete pushover later on who couldn't do anything for herself. 
As for the soundtrack...its not bad, but the constant repetition of ALMOST PARADIIISSEEE makes me want to tear my ears off. But then they change it up a bit in the second half of the drama which I appreciated.
What I liked about this drama was that there was enough going on to keep me invested. It's actually not that predictable. Sure it has a lot of cliches but you don't always know what's gonna happen. But then they pulled the amnesia card and it really made me wanna stop early.

Now, my usual writing style is a little heavy on [puns](https://i.imgur.com/OOwcLuY.jpg) so I’ll try to control those urges. Ahjumma (the-other-otter) asked me a bunch of questions but I haven’t answered any of them here. Not even the one that was drama centric, sorry.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART ONE: Outing Myself**

If my friends and family members were unaware of my interest in all things K-drama it was time they found out…

Throughout my trip I noted things that were from various dramas on my photos so it wasn’t long before people were asking me, “are all your travels based on tv shows?” to which I could honestly answer, ""no"". I’m not the most organised traveller and while I went with a head full of ideas of things I would love to do and see, the only drama site I planned on searching out in advance was the [snack food store](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/appa-bunsik/) from my all time favourite drama, *Father is Strange*. The lovely u/michkdl of [Korean Dramaland](https://koreandramaland.com/) had helped me track it down in advance and warned me it was pretty far out of Seoul in Suwon but [I was hyped for my pilgrimage](https://i.imgur.com/OMa5STe.png) and planned a day of sightseeing around it.

When the day finally arrived all my planning fell into place and it was one of the most memorable, exhausting days of my trip. My step count was only in the 26,000 range but a large proportion of them were stairs (Korea needs no army, they can just weaponise staircases). First things first I headed to [Appa’s Snack Food](https://i.imgur.com/zytlNy8.jpg), as expected it was a mess, abandoned. There were still traces of the snackfood store, I took my photos and headed around the corner to [peer in the doorway](https://i.imgur.com/d6ZtxzH.jpg) that lead to their home. Happy to have seen it I headed to my next destination, [Paldalmun Gate](https://i.imgur.com/O9TkePE.jpg) the beginning of my trek around the Hwaseong Fortress. First stop was [Hwaseong Haenggung](https://i.imgur.com/TDwahcf.jpg) the temporary palace, which I could have easily spent much longer [exploring](https://i.imgur.com/K6YFt2L.jpg). It was where *Jang Dae Geum* was filmed so you can [see the costumes](https://i.imgur.com/5loXM3L.jpg)/[props](https://i.imgur.com/Y6FdIYA.jpg) from that and even wear them if you go on the weekend. After [many stairs](https://i.imgur.com/UH1ITw9.jpg) were climbed I continued [around the fortress](https://i.imgur.com/CXrAeFx.jpg), but it was not without drama, I had [enemies to overcome by force](https://i.imgur.com/5fhD43B.jpg). The rest of my day was just filled with [toilet humor](https://i.imgur.com/2kwGYDc.jpg) worse than what you see in the *Reply* series...

&amp;#x200B;

**PART TWO: Let’s Eat**

Other than visiting Father’s Snack Food that the things I was most excited for was the cherry blossoms and the food. Now I love a good spring drama, but even more than that I love me some food porn. Readers of [my EXO-llent fanfiction](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/azc9zn/weekly_binge_march_mini_madness_exo_next_door/) will know there was no visits to Subway on my itinerary. I had my [Let’s Eat checklist](https://noonasoverforks.com/2014/03/14/lets-eat-the-checklist-and-food-gallery/) at the back of my mind and further inspiration from recent favourite, *Jang Dae Geum is Watching* but sadly only one stomach to devour it all. I wasn’t surprised to find out that most convenience stores weren’t as magical as the one that Jang Mi visited in the drama and didn’t end up trying any of [her master recipes out](http://www.geekykitch.com/2019/01/kdrama-korean-convenience-store-recipes.html). While there was sadly no [Shut up and Eat Gimbap](https://i.imgur.com/QLKFkuh.png) on my menu, I did invent my very own [soju cocktail](https://i.imgur.com/BK035J9.jpg) she would have been proud of after failing to find everything to make hers on the first attempt. While I wanted to visit all the [restaurants on San Hae’s bucket list](https://koreandramaland.com/restaurants-of-kdrama-dae-jang-geum-is-watching-part-1/) I only made it to one of them, [Gwanghwamun Gukbap](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/gwanghwamun-gukbap/). The food was definitely [worthy of bucket list status](https://i.imgur.com/2hGp7pS.jpg), for bonus points they seated me in the [same seat as Peaches](https://i.imgur.com/eTCTFzL.png). San Hae only gave it three stars but I liked the lighter tasting broth slightly more than the [traditional Gukbap I had sampled in Busan](https://i.imgur.com/gShFGKB.jpg).

While I didn’t search out the restaurant that Lee Seo Yeon visits in *Let’s Eat 3* on her obsessive quest for kimchi sujebi, I knew I had to try sujebi while in Busan. So I took a cooking class and learnt [how to make it](https://i.imgur.com/jrHUHiN.jpg). It was easily one of my favourite parts of the trip, and I’m still living off being told “hwaiting” from a real life oppa while I attempted to not break down into tears from assault by onion.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 3: Winter Sonata vs. Sian**

With less than a month before my trip I set myself the task of watching *Winter Sonata* as in the CLASSIC drama necessary for all fans of Korean dramas. Anyone who listened to me complaining about my struggles watching this in low quality with all the birth secrets and the men who felt they owned the female lead will be pleased to know my pain was worthwhile as *Winter Sonata* is everywhere and everything, no joke. Not just [Nami Island](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/namiseom-island/), EVERYWHERE lays claim to *Winter Sonata*, EVERYWHERE. So it was good to be constantly reminded of how much I hated it and laugh. OK. So, [there was this one part of the drama I really liked](https://i.imgur.com/zh79TRJ.png)… but enough of my *Winter Sonata* review.

But why did you go to Nami Island if you hated *Winter Sonata*, you ask? Well, I was attempting to be an organised tourist and assumed I would love this classic, beloved drama so booked a [tour](https://www.trazy.com/experience/detail/nami-island-garden-of-morning-calm-tour) after seeing a post on r/KDRAMA mentioning them. From the get go I was more interested in the [Garden of Morning Calm](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/garden-of-morning-calm/) part of the tour anyway (so many dramas I love were filmed here, but [the pond garden from Moonlight Drawn by Clouds was simply gorgeous](https://i.imgur.com/A09PnkD.jpg)). Now Nami Island is definitely tourist hell, you [cram yourself into a ferry](https://i.imgur.com/ZfVHt0k.jpg) or if you are a thrill seeker take the zipline, and arrive as a [part of the horde](https://i.imgur.com/G3XMlYB.jpg), everywhere you look there are [snowmen](https://i.imgur.com/Z4m9ZQW.jpg) of all shapes and sizes. They certainly saw an opportunity to make some money and grasped it. In between the [photo ops](https://i.imgur.com/gZM1qAN.jpg) there is some beautiful nature, other touristy stuff, there is a [huge library of picture books](https://i.imgur.com/jyKoIcC.jpg) and [reading nooks](https://i.imgur.com/e6nMsbH.jpg) scattered around the island so I managed to have a pretty good time despite feeling like I was creeping on all the couples getting lovey dovey whilst reenacting the drama at every given opportunity.

I also took another tour of [another island that also featured in Winter Sonata](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/oedo-botania-%ec%99%b8%eb%8f%84-%eb%b3%b4%ed%83%80%eb%8b%88%ec%95%84/) that [Lonely Planet strongly advises avoiding](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/attractions/oedo-botania/a/poi-sig/1428221/357351), and shocked everyone that I had heard of the other mediocre drama that was filmed there, *Hospital Ship*. It seemed like the warning had worked as in comparison to other tourist traps it [wasn’t overly busy](https://i.imgur.com/ieFun1V.jpg). Despite my feelings about the drama, the island was a nice place to explore, full of [manicured](https://i.imgur.com/v2Tu15u.jpg) [gardens](https://i.imgur.com/5vniLD2.jpg), [intriguing art works](https://i.imgur.com/pA5VoGp.jpg), one of the [most interesting lighthouses](https://i.imgur.com/jOdteym.jpg) I’ve seen ([HS kiss scene alert](https://youtu.be/l8AlPZhDETA?t=67)) definitely making the island worthy of its status as cutie Dr. Kwak’s special place.

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 4: Binge Crew Take Over Seoul**

About halfway through my trip I was lucky enough to score a short visit from one of my fellow bingers, u/MerinoMedia. Now the dramas we agree on can probably be counted on our fingers… namely **Terius Behind Me**, **12 Nights**, **Missing 9** and **Radiant Office**. Our mission objective of our time together was of course [Mojitos at Namsan Tower](https://i.imgur.com/G9jLWHT.png) AND OH BOY DID WE FAIL HARD. I mean we had an excellent time doing the *Boys Over Flowers* date [minus all the chaebol benefits](https://i.imgur.com/HXQRvkP.jpg). But in the end we were devastated to find that somewhere in the five months between *Terius* ending and our visit N Terrace had removed hard liquor from their menu. Like, you could still see where they had removed the word ‘cocktails’ from the wall. Gutted, we accepted our fate, admittedly slightly better than that of Choi Yeon Kyung who never even made it to Namsan in the first place, and settled for alternate beverages. So, fans of *Terius* if you are attempting to recreate that scene, be prepared and BYO mojito mix. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Rewind the clock a few hours and we were keeping busy filming our very own sageuk in and around Gyeongbokgung Palace, [Merry, Sian and the Magistrate](https://i.imgur.com/PFbPvHe.jpg)… or [King3Hearts](https://i.imgur.com/GtAyq03.jpg). Honestly things were written very hastily by indecisive writers, and there was no room in the budget for appropriate footwear as it all was spent on hats.

Since it was peak cherry blossom time and our shared affection for *Radiant Office* I proposed we have a [cherry blossom picnic](https://i.imgur.com/SiFG9J0.jpg) at [Ilsan Lake Park](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/ilsan-lake-park/), the home of happy endings. This location pops up in so many dramas it felt super familiar despite neither of us having been there before. Anyway, it is a [really](https://i.imgur.com/wu6ylfQ.jpg) [lovely](https://i.imgur.com/hFOWM88.jpg) [location](https://i.imgur.com/54erRi3.jpg) to relax, [eat fried chicken](https://i.imgur.com/TRx8r9Y.jpg) and sing Kdrama OSTs at the top of your lungs… Yes, [*Love is the Moment*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh6K4opYGk) was on our rotation.

For our final meal together we went with some PPL inspired cravings and went to a [tteokbokki](https://i.imgur.com/CcXUD6n.jpg) [buffet](https://i.imgur.com/htz65Ec.jpg) followed by delicious [bingsu](https://i.imgur.com/inaiwow.jpg).

&amp;#x200B;

**PART 5:** **~~Terius~~** **Merry Behind me.**

After Merry left I attempted to have a *Heirs* themed day as the Weekly Binge had recently watched it together. After attempting to visit two seperate locations of Mango Six on my way to the [royal tombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seonjeongneung) (excellent btw) I worked out the gig was definitely up and they had gone out of business, alas. So, I ended up settling for a [Choi Yeong Do inspired lunch](https://i.imgur.com/50O7vWf.jpg), because (and I bet I misremember the quote) “you can never feel lonely eating at a convenience store”. Plus Merry kept talking about getting gimbap on her way home and the idea was planted.

Sadly, Merry and I didn’t have enough time to visit any of the locations from *12 Nights* together so I played the is it [this chair or that chair game](https://i.imgur.com/crFld1w.jpg) alone, well as alone as you can feel as endless stream of students walk past saying, “hello” to the ‘영국 사람’. [Naksan Park](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/naksan-park-%eb%82%99%ec%82%b0%ea%b3%b5%ec%9b%90/) is pretty recognisable as so many dramas have been filmed there, and you can totally blame *King2Hearts* (and other dramas I’m sure) for [this sign](https://i.imgur.com/DhulxFi.jpg), Jo Jung Suk was pretty cool in that scene so I can understand people wanting to emulate him.

The last few locations I ended up visiting were from more recent dramas.

*Romance is a Bonus Book*: I took a day trip out to Hyeri Art Village (I also visited the Seoul Action School to watch Lee Seung Gi wannabes tumbling for them *My Girlfriend is a Gumiho* feels) and stopped by the [Blume Museum of Contemporary Art](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/blume-museum-of-contemporary-art/) where they housed a tiny, [child-centric gardening exhibit](https://i.imgur.com/nWtZqzS.jpg), the museum itself is [built around a tree so looks pretty fascinating](https://i.imgur.com/wqVFRh0.jpg) from the outside. After exploring the village I headed back to Paju Book City and stopped by one of the cafes from the drama, [Cafe Paper Tree](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/cafe-paper-tree/) for [a break](https://i.imgur.com/9t05zlh.jpg) before walking to the [home of Gyeoroo Publishing](https://i.imgur.com/R64Wh9t.jpg), the [Forest of Wisdom](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/forest-of-wisdom-library/). I also picked up a copy of [Na Tae Joo’s, I Want to Give you my Most Beautiful Thoughts](https://i.imgur.com/m87Vz3x.jpg) (ngl the rest of my souvenirs are all drama OSTs and sheet masks).

After a trip to Hyeri I was keen to check out some more art and thanks to *Encounter* I knew about an [amazing outdoor artspace](https://i.imgur.com/01k59mY.png) beneath the [Hongnam Bridge](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/hongnam-bridge/) so was able to [take a walk ](https://i.imgur.com/A8dMacD.jpg)[along Hongjecheon](https://i.imgur.com/astCumN.jpg) enjoying the [beautiful spring](https://i.imgur.com/pIKRuBP.jpg) weather and the [artworks](https://i.imgur.com/cL0Sweo.jpg) along the way. As a bonus the walk ends at a [fantastic waterfall](https://i.imgur.com/oy2Tkre.jpg) worthy of [escaping hospital](https://i.imgur.com/93ZVOq5.jpg) to see (I looked on the map and I swear there weren’t any hospitals nearby...). It was easily worth watching the drama to find this location.

To conclude the trip, I saved the cheesiest location of all, [Everland](https://koreandramaland.com/listings/everland-%ec%97%90%eb%b2%84%eb%9e%9c%eb%93%9c/). I’ve definitely seen a pile of dramas filmed at that location, most recently *What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim* and drama special, *I’ll Die Soon*. While the ride I most wanted to go on was [closed for maintenance](https://i.imgur.com/3lkwVaA.jpg), I wasn’t leaving without riding that [Merry-go-round](https://i.imgur.com/sm05xxG.jpg).

With only a few hours before my departure I managed to fulfil one last trope by getting a massive scratch on my arm whilst sorting the trash, a perfect excuse to buy [magical ointment](https://i.imgur.com/bH7zgB6.jpg). Lastly I ~~messed with some tensa barriers~~ ~~threw down some check in machines~~ was impressed by [cute robots](https://i.imgur.com/cFsW1pM.jpg) at Incheon Airport ala *Where Stars Land.*

The lovely &lt;a href=""/u/michkdl""&gt;u/michkdl&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/""&gt;Korean Dramaland&lt;/a&gt; had helped me track it down in advance and warned me it was pretty far out of Seoul in Suwon but &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/OMa5STe.png""&gt;I was hyped for my pilgrimage&lt;/a&gt; and planned a day of sightseeing around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the day finally arrived all my planning fell into place and it was one of the most memorable, exhausting days of my trip. My step count was only in the 26,000 range but a large proportion of them were stairs (Korea needs no army, they can just weaponise staircases). First things first I headed to &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/zytlNy8.jpg""&gt;Appa’s Snack Food&lt;/a&gt;, as expected it was a mess, abandoned. There were still traces of the snackfood store, I took my photos and headed around the corner to &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/d6ZtxzH.jpg""&gt;peer in the doorway&lt;/a&gt; that lead to their home. Happy to have seen it I headed to my next destination, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/O9TkePE.jpg""&gt;Paldalmun Gate&lt;/a&gt; the beginning of my trek around the Hwaseong Fortress. First stop was &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/TDwahcf.jpg""&gt;Hwaseong Haenggung&lt;/a&gt; the temporary palace, which I could have easily spent much longer &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/K6YFt2L.jpg""&gt;exploring&lt;/a&gt;. It was where &lt;em&gt;Jang Dae Geum&lt;/em&gt; was filmed so you can &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5loXM3L.jpg""&gt;see the costumes&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Y6FdIYA.jpg""&gt;props&lt;/a&gt; from that and even wear them if you go on the weekend. After &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/UH1ITw9.jpg""&gt;many stairs&lt;/a&gt; were climbed I continued &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/CXrAeFx.jpg""&gt;around the fortress&lt;/a&gt;, but it was not without drama, I had &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5fhD43B.jpg""&gt;enemies to overcome by force&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of my day was just filled with &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/2kwGYDc.jpg""&gt;toilet humor&lt;/a&gt; worse than what you see in the &lt;em&gt;Reply&lt;/em&gt; series...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART TWO: Let’s Eat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than visiting Father’s Snack Food that the things I was most excited for was the cherry blossoms and the food. Now I love a good spring drama, but even more than that I love me some food porn. Readers of &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/azc9zn/weekly_binge_march_mini_madness_exo_next_door/""&gt;my EXO-llent fanfiction&lt;/a&gt; will know there was no visits to Subway on my itinerary. I had my &lt;a href=""https://noonasoverforks.com/2014/03/14/lets-eat-the-checklist-and-food-gallery/""&gt;Let’s Eat checklist&lt;/a&gt; at the back of my mind and further inspiration from recent favourite, &lt;em&gt;Jang Dae Geum is Watching&lt;/em&gt; but sadly only one stomach to devour it all. I wasn’t surprised to find out that most convenience stores weren’t as magical as the one that Jang Mi visited in the drama and didn’t end up trying any of &lt;a href=""http://www.geekykitch.com/2019/01/kdrama-korean-convenience-store-recipes.html""&gt;her master recipes out&lt;/a&gt;. While there was sadly no &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/QLKFkuh.png""&gt;Shut up and Eat Gimbap&lt;/a&gt; on my menu, I did invent my very own &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/BK035J9.jpg""&gt;soju cocktail&lt;/a&gt; she would have been proud of after failing to find everything to make hers on the first attempt. While I wanted to visit all the &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/restaurants-of-kdrama-dae-jang-geum-is-watching-part-1/""&gt;restaurants on San Hae’s bucket list&lt;/a&gt; I only made it to one of them, &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/gwanghwamun-gukbap/""&gt;Gwanghwamun Gukbap&lt;/a&gt;. The food was definitely &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/2hGp7pS.jpg""&gt;worthy of bucket list status&lt;/a&gt;, for bonus points they seated me in the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/eTCTFzL.png""&gt;same seat as Peaches&lt;/a&gt;. San Hae only gave it three stars but I liked the lighter tasting broth slightly more than the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/gShFGKB.jpg""&gt;traditional Gukbap I had sampled in Busan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I didn’t search out the restaurant that Lee Seo Yeon visits in &lt;em&gt;Let’s Eat 3&lt;/em&gt; on her obsessive quest for kimchi sujebi, I knew I had to try sujebi while in Busan. So I took a cooking class and learnt &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/jrHUHiN.jpg""&gt;how to make it&lt;/a&gt;. It was easily one of my favourite parts of the trip, and I’m still living off being told “hwaiting” from a real life oppa while I attempted to not break down into tears from assault by onion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART 3: Winter Sonata vs. Sian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With less than a month before my trip I set myself the task of watching &lt;em&gt;Winter Sonata&lt;/em&gt; as in the CLASSIC drama necessary for all fans of Korean dramas. Anyone who listened to me complaining about my struggles watching this in low quality with all the birth secrets and the men who felt they owned the female lead will be pleased to know my pain was worthwhile as &lt;em&gt;Winter Sonata&lt;/em&gt; is everywhere and everything, no joke. Not just &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/namiseom-island/""&gt;Nami Island&lt;/a&gt;, EVERYWHERE lays claim to &lt;em&gt;Winter Sonata&lt;/em&gt;, EVERYWHERE. So it was good to be constantly reminded of how much I hated it and laugh. OK. So, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/zh79TRJ.png""&gt;there was this one part of the drama I really liked&lt;/a&gt;… but enough of my &lt;em&gt;Winter Sonata&lt;/em&gt; review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why did you go to Nami Island if you hated &lt;em&gt;Winter Sonata&lt;/em&gt;, you ask? Well, I was attempting to be an organised tourist and assumed I would love this classic, beloved drama so booked a &lt;a href=""https://www.trazy.com/experience/detail/nami-island-garden-of-morning-calm-tour""&gt;tour&lt;/a&gt; after seeing a post on &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; mentioning them. From the get go I was more interested in the &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/garden-of-morning-calm/""&gt;Garden of Morning Calm&lt;/a&gt; part of the tour anyway (so many dramas I love were filmed here, but &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/A09PnkD.jpg""&gt;the pond garden from Moonlight Drawn by Clouds was simply gorgeous&lt;/a&gt;). Now Nami Island is definitely tourist hell, you &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ZfVHt0k.jpg""&gt;cram yourself into a ferry&lt;/a&gt; or if you are a thrill seeker take the zipline, and arrive as a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/G3XMlYB.jpg""&gt;part of the horde&lt;/a&gt;, everywhere you look there are &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/Z4m9ZQW.jpg""&gt;snowmen&lt;/a&gt; of all shapes and sizes. They certainly saw an opportunity to make some money and grasped it. In between the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/gZM1qAN.jpg""&gt;photo ops&lt;/a&gt; there is some beautiful nature, other touristy stuff, there is a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/jyKoIcC.jpg""&gt;huge library of picture books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/e6nMsbH.jpg""&gt;reading nooks&lt;/a&gt; scattered around the island so I managed to have a pretty good time despite feeling like I was creeping on all the couples getting lovey dovey whilst reenacting the drama at every given opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also took another tour of &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/oedo-botania-%ec%99%b8%eb%8f%84-%eb%b3%b4%ed%83%80%eb%8b%88%ec%95%84/""&gt;another island that also featured in Winter Sonata&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=""https://www.lonelyplanet.com/south-korea/attractions/oedo-botania/a/poi-sig/1428221/357351""&gt;Lonely Planet strongly advises avoiding&lt;/a&gt;, and shocked everyone that I had heard of the other mediocre drama that was filmed there, &lt;em&gt;Hospital Ship&lt;/em&gt;. It seemed like the warning had worked as in comparison to other tourist traps it &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/ieFun1V.jpg""&gt;wasn’t overly busy&lt;/a&gt;. Despite my feelings about the drama, the island was a nice place to explore, full of &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/v2Tu15u.jpg""&gt;manicured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/5vniLD2.jpg""&gt;gardens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/pA5VoGp.jpg""&gt;intriguing art works&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/jOdteym.jpg""&gt;most interesting lighthouses&lt;/a&gt; I’ve seen (&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/l8AlPZhDETA?t=67""&gt;HS kiss scene alert&lt;/a&gt;) definitely making the island worthy of its status as cutie Dr. Kwak’s special place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART 4: Binge Crew Take Over Seoul&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About halfway through my trip I was lucky enough to score a short visit from one of my fellow bingers, &lt;a href=""/u/MerinoMedia""&gt;u/MerinoMedia&lt;/a&gt;. Now the dramas we agree on can probably be counted on our fingers… namely &lt;strong&gt;Terius Behind Me&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;12 Nights&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Missing 9&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/strong&gt;. Our mission objective of our time together was of course &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/G9jLWHT.png""&gt;Mojitos at Namsan Tower&lt;/a&gt; AND OH BOY DID WE FAIL HARD. I mean we had an excellent time doing the &lt;em&gt;Boys Over Flowers&lt;/em&gt; date &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/HXQRvkP.jpg""&gt;minus all the chaebol benefits&lt;/a&gt;. But in the end we were devastated to find that somewhere in the five months between &lt;em&gt;Terius&lt;/em&gt; ending and our visit N Terrace had removed hard liquor from their menu. Like, you could still see where they had removed the word ‘cocktails’ from the wall. Gutted, we accepted our fate, admittedly slightly better than that of Choi Yeon Kyung who never even made it to Namsan in the first place, and settled for alternate beverages. So, fans of &lt;em&gt;Terius&lt;/em&gt; if you are attempting to recreate that scene, be prepared and BYO mojito mix. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewind the clock a few hours and we were keeping busy filming our very own sageuk in and around Gyeongbokgung Palace, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/PFbPvHe.jpg""&gt;Merry, Sian and the Magistrate&lt;/a&gt;… or &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/GtAyq03.jpg""&gt;King3Hearts&lt;/a&gt;. Honestly things were written very hastily by indecisive writers, and there was no room in the budget for appropriate footwear as it all was spent on hats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was peak cherry blossom time and our shared affection for &lt;em&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/em&gt; I proposed we have a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/SiFG9J0.jpg""&gt;cherry blossom picnic&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/ilsan-lake-park/""&gt;Ilsan Lake Park&lt;/a&gt;, the home of happy endings. This location pops up in so many dramas it felt super familiar despite neither of us having been there before. Anyway, it is a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/wu6ylfQ.jpg""&gt;really&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/hFOWM88.jpg""&gt;lovely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/54erRi3.jpg""&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; to relax, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/TRx8r9Y.jpg""&gt;eat fried chicken&lt;/a&gt; and sing Kdrama OSTs at the top of your lungs… Yes, &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jh6K4opYGk""&gt;&lt;em&gt;Love is the Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was on our rotation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our final meal together we went with some PPL inspired cravings and went to a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/CcXUD6n.jpg""&gt;tteokbokki&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/htz65Ec.jpg""&gt;buffet&lt;/a&gt; followed by delicious &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/inaiwow.jpg""&gt;bingsu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PART 5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;del&gt;Terius&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Merry Behind me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Merry left I attempted to have a &lt;em&gt;Heirs&lt;/em&gt; themed day as the Weekly Binge had recently watched it together. After attempting to visit two seperate locations of Mango Six on my way to the &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seonjeongneung""&gt;royal tombs&lt;/a&gt; (excellent btw) I worked out the gig was definitely up and they had gone out of business, alas. So, I ended up settling for a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/50O7vWf.jpg""&gt;Choi Yeong Do inspired lunch&lt;/a&gt;, because (and I bet I misremember the quote) “you can never feel lonely eating at a convenience store”. Plus Merry kept talking about getting gimbap on her way home and the idea was planted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Merry and I didn’t have enough time to visit any of the locations from &lt;em&gt;12 Nights&lt;/em&gt; together so I played the is it &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/crFld1w.jpg""&gt;this chair or that chair game&lt;/a&gt; alone, well as alone as you can feel as endless stream of students walk past saying, “hello” to the ‘영국 사람’. &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/naksan-park-%eb%82%99%ec%82%b0%ea%b3%b5%ec%9b%90/""&gt;Naksan Park&lt;/a&gt; is pretty recognisable as so many dramas have been filmed there, and you can totally blame &lt;em&gt;King2Hearts&lt;/em&gt; (and other dramas I’m sure) for &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/DhulxFi.jpg""&gt;this sign&lt;/a&gt;, Jo Jung Suk was pretty cool in that scene so I can understand people wanting to emulate him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last few locations I ended up visiting were from more recent dramas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Romance is a Bonus Book&lt;/em&gt;: I took a day trip out to Hyeri Art Village (I also visited the Seoul Action School to watch Lee Seung Gi wannabes tumbling for them &lt;em&gt;My Girlfriend is a Gumiho&lt;/em&gt; feels) and stopped by the &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/blume-museum-of-contemporary-art/""&gt;Blume Museum of Contemporary Art&lt;/a&gt; where they housed a tiny, &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/nWtZqzS.jpg""&gt;child-centric gardening exhibit&lt;/a&gt;, the museum itself is &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/wqVFRh0.jpg""&gt;built around a tree so looks pretty fascinating&lt;/a&gt; from the outside. After exploring the village I headed back to Paju Book City and stopped by one of the cafes from the drama, &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/cafe-paper-tree/""&gt;Cafe Paper Tree&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/9t05zlh.jpg""&gt;a break&lt;/a&gt; before walking to the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/R64Wh9t.jpg""&gt;home of Gyeoroo Publishing&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/forest-of-wisdom-library/""&gt;Forest of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;. I also picked up a copy of &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/m87Vz3x.jpg""&gt;Na Tae Joo’s, I Want to Give you my Most Beautiful Thoughts&lt;/a&gt; (ngl the rest of my souvenirs are all drama OSTs and sheet masks).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a trip to Hyeri I was keen to check out some more art and thanks to &lt;em&gt;Encounter&lt;/em&gt; I knew about an &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/01k59mY.png""&gt;amazing outdoor artspace&lt;/a&gt; beneath the &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/hongnam-bridge/""&gt;Hongnam Bridge&lt;/a&gt; so was able to &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/A8dMacD.jpg""&gt;take a walk &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/astCumN.jpg""&gt;along Hongjecheon&lt;/a&gt; enjoying the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/pIKRuBP.jpg""&gt;beautiful spring&lt;/a&gt; weather and the &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/cL0Sweo.jpg""&gt;artworks&lt;/a&gt; along the way. As a bonus the walk ends at a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/oy2Tkre.jpg""&gt;fantastic waterfall&lt;/a&gt; worthy of &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/93ZVOq5.jpg""&gt;escaping hospital&lt;/a&gt; to see (I looked on the map and I swear there weren’t any hospitals nearby...). It was easily worth watching the drama to find this location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To conclude the trip, I saved the cheesiest location of all, &lt;a href=""https://koreandramaland.com/listings/everland-%ec%97%90%eb%b2%84%eb%9e%9c%eb%93%9c/""&gt;Everland&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve definitely seen a pile of dramas filmed at that location, most recently &lt;em&gt;What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim&lt;/em&gt; and drama special, &lt;em&gt;I’ll Die Soon&lt;/em&gt;. While the ride I most wanted to go on was &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/3lkwVaA.jpg""&gt;closed for maintenance&lt;/a&gt;, I wasn’t leaving without riding that &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/sm05xxG.jpg""&gt;Merry-go-round&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With only a few hours before my departure I managed to fulfil one last trope by getting a massive scratch on my arm whilst sorting the trash, a perfect excuse to buy &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/bH7zgB6.jpg""&gt;magical ointment&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly I &lt;del&gt;messed with some tensa barriers&lt;/del&gt; &lt;del&gt;threw down some check in machines&lt;/del&gt; was impressed by &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/cFsW1pM.jpg""&gt;cute robots&lt;/a&gt; at Incheon Airport ala &lt;em&gt;Where Stars Land.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

First of all, I should mention that I don't usually think of kdramas as being especially funny. I think maybe it's just that we don't share the same type of humour, or that sometimes things get lost in translation, and so while most have funny moments, I don't usually think of them as being comedies. But damn if this show isn't making me change my mind. Jo Jung Seok is killing me; I feel like he's ""on"" all the time. Even when he's reacting to things (especially when he's reacting to things) his facial expressions are perfect. Jo Jung Seok is to bewilderment what wet is to water. And I love that it's given me a new appreciation for humour in kdramas, when before I had almost felt a little distant from them, because the lack of any humour just doesn't ring true to real life experience.

The other thing that I love is the way the show is layered. Because of the way the plot is set up, it's clear that the two main characters are having entirely different experiences, and every scene reflects that. Both actors are so good at playing that up, and so while a moment may be comedic, it's never just comedic. It'll have an emotion pull to it. It's like the difference between saying that water is blue and saying that water is blueish-greenish-brownish (to continue that terrible metaphor lol). It just adds depth, and I love it. 

Anyway there area bunch of other reasons that I love the show, but I just wanted to see if anyone here felt the same way at all about this drama and dramas in general.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little bit late, but I just started watching Jealousy Incarnate after hearing some good things about it.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. 

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

This is our 6th subreddit census. Can you believe it?

The census is a mix of questions about demographic information, drama watching habits, drama watching preferences, languages, and other related topics. The responses are for general information and general entertainment purposes. 

_____
_____

The results will be tallied at the end of the census period and will be reported in a separate post.

A few notes:

* This is an anonymous census; nothing personally identifying is collected or kept.

* The Demographics portion is mandatory, but you can select a 'chose not to answer' option. Try to answer all the questions. That's the point of this whole thing.

   * I have tweaked the World Region question a bit. I hope I listed all the countries. Some countries may be considered Asian or European (meaning they overlap depending on who's defining things). I didn't want to arbitrarily separate, so some countries are listed in Europe and Asia.

   * I also changed up the Race/Ethnicity choices. I understand that our Non-USA friends view and deal with ethnicity differently. I have provided a 'white' and 'non-white' option (that may include European, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean ethnicities). 

* You can edit your responses! **This is extremely important for when the inevitable mistakes are discovered and corrected.** I will post a separate comment announcing major changes that require editing your responses.

* It's explained in the survey instructions, but fill-in-the-blank response options are not for jokes or hateful comments.

Here's some things that I wanted Ti point out , what do you think about them.(I could be wrong so plz be gentle) 

1) Some dramas don't hook the viewer straight at episode one.I understand that this is a difficult thing to do, but even on episode 2 the story is not properly set up.I like Goblin cuz right in episode we get Kim Shin's backstory and his motivation going into the future and how it ties into other characters.

2) Maybe it's just me but some dramas are hard to finish. Reply 1988 thought good , took me time to finish.(the fack that's the 80s nostalgia had no effect on me since I wasn't around at that time probably didn't help) 

3) I can't understand the Korean defenition of ""melodrama"".Movie and shows within the melodrama genre feel different when I watch Korean compared to Western. 

4) I need someone to explain and guide me through the ""00s"" era dramas example autmn in my heart, winter sonata, stairway to heaven, full house. I'm kinda lost and don't know what to watch and how to judge as they seen completely different from modern dramas .I want to know what this era was all about, the common tropes, the actors during this time etc

5) what is up with the ratings on IMDb, I see a lot of dramas with 8s and near 8s. I find I hard to believe that so many can have such high ratings.

Tons of K-Pop idols attempt to dip their toes into acting but not a lot of them even turn out decent, while those who actually qualify as 'good' are far even fewer.

With female idols, I think Eunji of A-Pink remains unforgettable. Among the leading ladies of the Reply series, I think she put out the strongest performance as she really owned her character. Though my friend argues that Eunji pretty much just played herself so it was great, but I was blown away with how she made the borderline crazy fan character quite empathic rather than annoying, which could easily happen with other actresses.

With male idols, I think the trio of Lee Joon of MBLAQ, Im Siwan of ZE:A and Do Kyungsoo of EXO are almost on par with each other though I can't help but acknowledge the range Lee Joon has, how subtle yet strong Siwan is or how Kyungsoo's eyes are amazing in expressing emotion. Me and my friend are torn with these three guys. I think Lee Joon's performance in Gapdong was stunning, Siwan of course had Misaeng, though I think his acting chops were flaunted amazingly in Triangle, and Kyungsoo has been slaying almost every acting role he has been picking.

This feels like a really good topic nowadays as a lot of the older idols from third gen K-Pop are enlisting which will put many groups into hiatus and encouraging idols to do more solo work, enabling their members to probably enter acting so we will be seeing a lot more idols in Korean dramas methinks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently having a friendly debate with a drama-watching friend about K-Pop idols who we think had strong acting outputs in Korean dramas.

Though my friend argues that Eunji pretty much just played herself so it was great, but I was blown away with how she made the borderline crazy fan character quite empathic rather than annoying, which could easily happen with other actresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With male idols, I think the trio of Lee Joon of MBLAQ, Im Siwan of ZE:A and Do Kyungsoo of EXO are almost on par with each other though I can&amp;#39;t help but acknowledge the range Lee Joon has, how subtle yet strong Siwan is or how Kyungsoo&amp;#39;s eyes are amazing in expressing emotion. Me and my friend are torn with these three guys. I think Lee Joon&amp;#39;s performance in Gapdong was stunning, Siwan of course had Misaeng, though I think his acting chops were flaunted amazingly in Triangle, and Kyungsoo has been slaying almost every acting role he has been picking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feels like a really good topic nowadays as a lot of the older idols from third gen K-Pop are enlisting which will put many groups into hiatus and encouraging idols to do more solo work, enabling their members to probably enter acting so we will be seeing a lot more idols in Korean dramas methinks.&lt;/p&gt;

Although not the oldest dramas currently still being a part of kdrama community discourse, I would like to propose a couple of dramas as being classics due to their influence and relevancy due this day.

Boys over Flowers (2009) and Secret Garden (2010) - The pop culture relevancy of these two dramas is still immense even almost ten years after their initial release. 

Reply 1997 (2012) - This drama played a major part in making TvN what it is today and immensely increased the popularity of cable dramas, both of which are entities that are extremely important in today’s kdrama landscape.

&amp;#x200B;

As promised, I made this post in order to let you know what I found through the survey so many of you were so nice to fill a few weeks ago. I´m sorry for taking this long, I finished with the analysis a week ago but due to a sudden and severe infection, I was not able to do anything other than stay in bed for the past couple of days. But enough with me, the important part is the results. 

&amp;#x200B;

First things first, the results are not 100% foolproof as it turned out to be very difficult to gather an approximately equal  number of answers from both fans and non fans. No matter the group or forum I posted the survey on, the end result was that there were fa more responses from fans than from non fans. This is one of the limitations that can skew the overall result, but I did find enough common elements in the responses to be able to come to certain conclusions.

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing analysed were the Likert scales for the destination attributes. The statistical analysis can be seen in the table below, but for those who did not take any statistics courses, the conclusion that can be drawn from it is that fans were more inclined to see South Korea as place of culture and history (especially in the case of traditional architecture), than non fans. 

https://i.redd.it/5zupo33n7k131.png

Then, I tried to code the open-ended questions and find the frequency fro each group. This ended up being a more tedious job than I imagined so there might have been answered I had to skip because they did not answer the questions as they were intended (for example, if the answer to the questions regarding ""What are the characteristics of South Korea that pop to mind?"" was ""beautiful"", well, that was not included as a valid response, sorry). But most responses were on point so, again, I had enough material to work with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q8. What images or characteristics come into mind when thinking about South Korea as a vacation destination?

  

https://i.redd.it/zc5lg9jkak131.png

From these results, it can be seen that both groups agree that ""food"" and ""nature"" are the first things that come to mind, but then their opinions diverge. Non fans see it more urbanized and modern, probably having in mind the stereotypical Asian metropolis, while fans see it as being more historical, while also associating it with K-pop music. Some fun facts that can be taken from this are that: 

1. Non fans associate South Korea with ""plastic surgery"" far more than fans, as they mentioned it 3 times in their responses, while fans did it only once. 
2. ""Jeju Island"" has basically the same popularity level for both groups (nice marketing strategy, I guess) 
3. Somehow, non fans see South Korea as more of a ""beauty products"" destination than fans (this was a surprise for me too)

Q9. How would you describe the atmosphere or mood that you would expect to experience while visiting South Korea?

https://i.redd.it/lhmsrgqick131.png

Just like in the case of the first question, the 2 main answers were similar for both groups: ""friendly"" and ""busy"". But then, non fans´ opinion shifted towards a calm sort of mood, while fans went with exciting as the 3rd most answered atmosphere attribute. Non fans also answered ""generic"" quite a lot, which, again, I assume that it refers to the stereotype of the average Asian city and had ""exciting"" as one of the least frequently answered words. Interestingly, fans see South Korea as more crowded than non fans, but definitely more ""fun"". There have also been those who see South Korea as a hostile destination for people of color and they are all, invariably, fans.  

&amp;#x200B;

Q10. What do you perceive as unique to South Korea as a destination?

https://i.redd.it/53slej70ek131.png

Again, ""culture"" and ""food"" were the most frequent for both, but it is pretty obvious that non fans have a lower frequency and that is mostly because of how dispersed their answers were here. I think this is the only question were the sampled non fan population was most probably not  enough for reliable data collection. But, I worked with what I got and the results are not as different from the attributes as to dismiss them as unreliable. ""Nature"" appears to be more of a theme for non fans than for fans, the latter preferring ""history"" and ""kpop music"" more.  Interestingly, non fans also answered ""kdrama"" and ""kpop music"", though, obviously, with a lower frequency, but they had a way higher frequency in answering ""people"" than the fans had (another surprise for me). 

According to Gunn´s ""Vacationscapes"" there are 3 steps of image formation: organic, when the image is based on assimilated information from non-touristic, non-commercial sources, like general media, education or friends; induced, when the initial image is modified after looking into more commercial sources of information, such as touristic brochures, websites or other sources influenced by the destination´s marketing efforts; and, finally, modified, which represents the perception of the destination after traveling there. Overall, it seems to me that rather than modifying the perception one had previously, the exposure to Korean pop culture merely adds on top of the organic layer of perception and that is why the top answers are still so similar, even though opinions seem to diverge afterwards. 

Lastly but not least, thanks you so much to everyone who participated both in the survey and in the discussion started in the comments. You were all amazing and I hope that you found the results at least a little bit interesting. 

P.S. I´m really sorry for the potato quality of the images, but I´m still not sure how to properly add images to a post.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everybody,&lt;/p&gt;

I'm curious to see if anyone shares the same views as me regarding Coach Kim.

After the finale, I honestly am not sure if I think that that Coach Kim was the real villain of the show. After all, all she was doing was EXACTLY what the parents/mothers of the children asked of her, if I'm not mistaken?
 I don't think her aim was *entirely* ruining the kids lives, they were just the vehicle for ruining the parents' lives. I think she deeply, deeply resented herself for what happened to her own daughter, so by punishing the parents for making the same mistakes she did, she's in a way punishing herself too. 
Though I agree she wasn't innocent by any means, but at the end of the day aren't the parents to blame for what happened to their children? Take Young-jae for example, I still do not think he, or Coach kim are to blame for his mothers death. Was Young-jae's anger towards his mother not valid? We all saw those flashbacks where his mother literally told him he shouldn't eat if he gets a ""low"" mark and so on. Was this something that coach Kim told the mothers to do? Her only request was to take care of their health. 
Also, from a mental health standpoint, I thought it was odd that this show tackles this issue quite well but didn’t hit the mark (imo) with young-Jae’s mother’s death. Is it really fair that another person, despite who it may be, is being held responsible for her action of suicide? I’m not sure.

Plus, Did she (coach Kim) not warn these mothers beforehand? IIRC, she said are you willing to accept any of the consequences that may follow? 

Idk, though I don't agree with coach kim by any means, I think her internal struggle could have been shown more because I think she had the most depth of all the characters. The parents, though redeemable (?) in the end, used coach kim to offset/absolve themselves of guilt for the outcomes of their children. People like coach kim only exist because parents like seojin and co. do as well.

Overall this show was the BOMB and I loved every second. Kim Seo Hyung deserves all the praise.

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within  the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you aged 50 years watching this, episodic notes, your skin care routine, a list of what you would do if one day you woke up and decades had passed you by, links to your favourite octogenarian social media star's page, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the final Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;strong&gt;Flower Grandpa Investigation Unit&lt;/strong&gt; for episodes 10 - 12.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

I've been dying to find a drama that I watched years ago - I've spent countless hours trying to Google it. I'm not even sure if it's Korean - it might be of other Asian origin.

I watched it around 2004/2005 - so it was definitely produced before then. 

I remember that it featured a seemingly rich guy who owned or worked for some sort of technology company - I remember in one of the episodes they were releasing a new flip phone. It was also set in a very modern city - so all historical dramas are excluded.

I also clearly remember another scene where the two main characters (presumably forbidden lovers) met at what seemed like a little wooden cabin out in the countryside - the cabin itself was built on a slight hill and there was one lone tree next to the cabin - it might have been a cherry tree. The music in that scene was so incredible I instantly became attracted to the film, but then it stopped airing in my country. The meeting at the cabin was very sombre - he seemed to be emotionally hurt and she was running after him, calling his name and crying. He turned around to see her and I just remember them hugging and crying with that incredible music in the background.

I've been a avid kdrama watcher for years, and lately the new shows have been meh. Maybe I am sick of the hot, rich, chaebol meets poor, cute, dork trope. 

It was so refreshing and I just LOVED that Pil-Sung as the main lead, was not classically handsome by Korean or Western standards. 
Also, loved how gorgeous Seo-Jung is compared to Pil-Sung. I don't think I've ever seen a Kdrama where the main lead stays unattractive the whole series. Seo-Jung never takes him to get the kdrama makeover, and I totally appreciated it. 


Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung had chemistry, they are both Tsunderes and it is awesome!!!!! I liked how they kept finding reasons to see each other and claiming they were just drinking buddies.

One scene was super cute, Pil-Sung had just done like a 20 hour stake-out, and is totally exhausted. He has finally gotten into bed when he gets a text from Seo-Jung asking to see a movie with her, he immediately rolls out of bed and out the door to see her. I squealed!!! So cute!!

They are a ton of touching scenes and romantic scenes in between Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung. There was actual progress being made in their relationship and as the situation gets more complex and serious so do Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung. 


I have read reviews on Reddit and other sites and it seems like a lot people hate the ending. I didn't spoil myself, but did read the show gets ""bad"" after a certain episode. They don't like the way Pil-Sung reacts to certain events etc. 

With that said, let's talk about Hwang Dae Do. His evil motivations revolve around his ""theory""  that people and the world are basically evil and selfish, like he is. He puts people in extreme situations, just to see how they will react and proof his ""theory"" correct.
Hwang Dae Do makes good on a promise he makes to Pil-Sung in one of the earlier episodes.

Both Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung are in over their heads and that becomes apparent from the start. Seo-Jung is spiritually strong, but has lived her life as a normal person.  Pil-Sung is a detective, he does have some spiritual awareness, but he also is just a normal dude. 

Some might not agree with the choices the characters make throughout the show. 
Especially Pil-Sung. He becomes the target of Hwang Dae Do and really the choices he has are limited.

I liked how everything went down. The acting was great, the music really fit the scenes.  The romance between Seo-Jung and Pil-Sung was just fantastic.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided to give Possessed a chance.

&lt;p&gt;They are a ton of touching scenes and romantic scenes in between Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung. There was actual progress being made in their relationship and as the situation gets more complex and serious so do Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have read reviews on Reddit and other sites and it seems like a lot people hate the ending. I didn&amp;#39;t spoil myself, but did read the show gets &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; after a certain episode. They don&amp;#39;t like the way Pil-Sung reacts to certain events etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, let&amp;#39;s talk about Hwang Dae Do. His evil motivations revolve around his &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot;  that people and the world are basically evil and selfish, like he is. He puts people in extreme situations, just to see how they will react and proof his &amp;quot;theory&amp;quot; correct.
Hwang Dae Do makes good on a promise he makes to Pil-Sung in one of the earlier episodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both Pil-Sung and Seo-Jung are in over their heads and that becomes apparent from the start. Seo-Jung is spiritually strong, but has lived her life as a normal person.  Pil-Sung is a detective, he does have some spiritual awareness, but he also is just a normal dude. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some might not agree with the choices the characters make throughout the show. 
Especially Pil-Sung. He becomes the target of Hwang Dae Do and really the choices he has are limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I liked how everything went down. The acting was great, the music really fit the scenes.  The romance between Seo-Jung and Pil-Sung was just fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

-	The general? Or someone else in charge constantly threatens her and tries to have her killed outside the palace but the prince stops his men and makes it clear that it is he who is in charge and must be obeyed
-	They fall in love, and the prince is constantly defending her and her motives (everyone else thinks she's still a spy)
-	I remember them riding a horse through a beautiful forest and having a moment by a lake
-	She does tell him that she's from the future and somehow got transported to the past, and he doesn't care about that because he loves her
-	At the end of the trailer, she's back in the present and it is raining at night. The prince somehow got teleported to the present and we see him with an umbrella approaching her

Here are some details of the trailer posting on YouTube that I remember:

-	I came across it while watching Well Intended Love, but don't remember if it's a drama that hasn't aired yet, is on going, or completed
-	It was an extended trailer/about 8 minutes long
-	The poster for the drama was the prince and woman together romantically in the bottom. Above them is everyone else in the drama that was against their love. The poster is mainly light pink with clouds
-	The title is somewhere along the lines of: The Legend of/ The Tale of/ The Story of. I tried these search words but couldn't find it. Proceeding that are 2-4 romanized words that can either be their names, the name of the palace, or location.

&amp;#x200B;

Really curious to see what other people have experienced and whether that has altered the way they watch dramas.

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I let a lot of stuff slide because it is happened to me... ok not some of it: there is very little product placement in my life and I've never had a gold-fish kiss or tree hug. But after thinking about it there were a lot of the more common cliches and tropes--some which really annoy viewers (childhood-fated lovers)--than I expected.

&amp;#x200B;

**For me:**

\-wrist grab, pull into a hug (this was dramatic on a fairly busy street)

\-wrist grab, pull into a kiss (literally best first kiss ever)

\-dated someone I knew from childhood x2 (one a long term friend and then one day we realised we had each liked the other for a long time but hadn't realised our feelings. The other was someone I reconnected with 10 years after we last saw each other…  I am not together with either of them but we did talk about how it felt like fate)

\-love triangle x2 (complicated, I don't recommend them)

\-guy saying something stupid/confessing to me while drunk

\-getting sick off someone when people weren’t supposed to know we were hooking up

\-back hug to be possessive in front of another guy

\-back hug to say ‘i’m sorry’ or another kind of 'confession'

\-v rich (family) bf 

\-dating a friend’s sibling

\-noble idiocy (so much because I choose emotionally unavailable, tortured artist types)

&amp;#x200B;

**Quite a lot of these overlapped:**

\-Long-lost childhood friend was also the wrist grab to kiss and a drunken confession

\-Love triangle #1 combo’d with drunken confession and also getting sick off of the same guy and an 'I’m sorry' back hug

\-The possessive back hug was another love triangle and the brother of my friend

\-V rich bf overlapped with back hugs, wrist grab into hug, and lots of noble idiocy","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Off the back of the other thread, I was wondering if anyone had experienced kdrama tropes and cliches in their own life.&lt;/p&gt;

In this post, I saw most people saying thy jump through a few boring scenes (mainly from the supporting cast) or even watch episodes using speeds settings available on video players like VLC. Why do people do this? Why not just pick a well written and directed drama? I feel like I'm missing something. I know that a lot of dramas have tropes and some of them are really boring (for me personally is that ""I knew you from when we were kids"") but isn't this also why we watch dramas?

I actually use variable speeds to listen to podcasts, but this is a visual format, and most of the time the pace of a performance is just as important as the script. With a podcast, you basically get people talking, and with sound (if there's no music involved) and can easily manipulate the speed of the interlocutor without losing too much (if any)  information, but can the same be said about an episode?

I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I actually tried to watch an episode at 1.25x speed and even though the first minutes were kinda weird, I actually didn't feel like I missed a lot and got comfortable with everything. But what's the price, you know? Is it the same as opening your smartphone when a character you don't like is on the screen? (I know a lot of you do this, haha). I am genuinely curious about what you guys have to say about this because I have not a proper opinion on this topic.

I really wanted to know if this is as common as that thread made me believe, or if we're so  anxious about the NEXT thing that we can't even enjoy what we're watching now, like a to-do list for stuff that people took time to make and we want to consume as fast as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a short drama so it is already time for nominations for our next watch. As Spring is coming to an end for most of the Binge Crew (and I'm still fondly reminiscing my cherry blossom filled holiday) the theme for this round is **spring dramas**. Drama nominations either need to have some part of the drama set in the spring time or have been released during Korea's spring months (March - April - May). As usual you will get a maximum of two nominations and must provide the details of at least one legal source, all nominations must be made as a reply to the nomination comment below.

If you are interested in checking out which dramas we have already watched [our MDL page is here](https://mydramalist.com/dramalist/WeeklyBinge). The list of nominations is available [here](https://mydramalist.com/list/W3rBe2z3).

These are available in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/policies) and in the Rules &amp; Policies section of the sidebar.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. 

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

* Please make sure you are using spoiler tags when discussing important plot details and other information. You can find the guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).

* Things like italics, headings, and table formatting are done using markdown.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Rules&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find them in our wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/rules""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Policies&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are available in the wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/policies""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Air Policy Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It&amp;#39;s a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what&amp;#39;s going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it&amp;#39;s best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There&amp;#39;s no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That&amp;#39;s where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Ratings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;General Tips and Tricks&lt;/h5&gt;

Maybe I came into it with too high expectations due to all the reviews of loving it and it being the best drama but it wasn’t that great of a show to me. After reading through some previous posts and reviews it seems that people liked 2 main things about this drama - the balance between genres and the chemistry between the two leads. However, the latter really disappointed me - I in fact did not enjoy the romance aspect of this drama very much. I was just wondering if anyone had similar opinions because there’s literally nobody that dislikes this drama lol.

The things I dislike about Healer:
- While CYS does use her skills and I guess we can consider her “brave”, the entire series almost EVERY single episode she requires being saved. Almost to the point where whenever she is alone or about to do something I didn’t even want to watch because I knew something was gonna happen to her. In my opinion, what was made out to be a strong FL became a really really weak one.

- Some reactions on both SJH and CYS parts I hated. I understand that they cared about each other a lot but sometimes when they were sad or separated and couldn’t communicate well it just didn’t make much sense.  

- There relationship wasn’t really based on much except that he felt some initial attraction to her and literally keeps saving her. As PBS maybe they developed a sort of mentor student friendship but I wouldn’t go as far to say as it could have evolved into any sort of relationship that quickly.

- Finally, didn’t really realize this until after but a lot of things just disappeared. A lot of people were just killed off which makes sense I guess when you’re watching. However after watching you think about it and it’s odd. Best examples are probably the girl at the beginning with the prostitution case and the chairman. Yes their storylines ended but like they just disappeared so fast. 

There are however things I liked:
- Loved the action scenes and SJH role as Healer, however sometimes I didn’t like his character when it was more drama less action

- I actually quite liked the overall story and the pacing was ok regarding that. The various clue hunting and reporting was nice as well.

- the supporting actors/characters were excellent, my favorite being ajhumma. Wished they gave her more of a background story actually. Both KMS and KMH brothers were played well too.

- I did think that the combination of action, drama, and romance was good. It was a good story and the production was wonderful. The balance of the three main genres was good it’s just that I didn’t like some of the aspects of each lol.

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every  week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different  time  zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party  (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything  you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you aged 50 years watching this, episodic notes, your skin care routine, a list of what you would do if one day you woke up and decades had passed you by, links to your favourite octogenarian social media star's page, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA)  (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the   chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to  watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a  review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/9605-flower-grandpa-investigation-unit""&gt;Flower Grandpa Investigation Unit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA""&gt; r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt;  (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the   chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to  watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a  review  to &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; that will convince others to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

Just finished the show about 40 mins ago and I need to say this about it. 

The past between Jeong Min and See Hee seemed very interesting to me. The way the drama touched on this topic without being insensitive about it made me really happy. 

I think what happened in See Hee’s past is a great way to turn an emotionless character into one who’s more traumatized than anything. He isn’t emotionless just because, unlike in many other dramas with characters like this. 

That said, I’d love to see a series dedicated to Jeong Min and See Hee’s past. I’d like to see how they got to know each other, how Jeong Min coped with the miscarriage and of course, how San Goo was doing back then! 

There’s a very slim chance of this happening, since the show came out about 2 years ago, but I’m just giving my two cents on it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers ahead. &lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

I have been working on a research project recently regarding how the korean pop culture (drama, Kpop, variety, etc.) affects the image fans have of South Korea. The aim of my study is to see the difference in perspective between fans and non-fans who are interested in traveling to the country, as well as how different is the before and after effect in the case of those who have already done that.

Korean drama, together with kpop and variety shows have increased quite a lot the number of tourists going to South Korea in recent times and I thought it would be interesting to see if the portrayal of korean life they sell to the rest of the world holds true to the reality

#Casts' final message to the fans. ㅠ.ㅠ

[source](https://www.soompi.com/article/1323912wpp/welcome-to-waikiki-2-cast-says-goodbye-with-final-thoughts)

* Kim Sunho - *It feels bittersweet that the end of a five-month journey is approaching. It doesn’t feel real that I won’t be able to regularly see the actors and staff who I worked with every day. It was a time where I could grow a lot. Since it was a joyful project where I laughed a lot during filming, it will remain in my memory for a long time. Thank you so much to viewers who cheered on the youth of Waikiki until this time. Please look forward to the final episode and whether the youth of Waikiki including Wooshik will be able to achieve both his dreams and love.*

* Lee Yikyung - *It’s difficult to put in words my love for Junki. He’s someone I love that much, and I’m not sure if that’s the reason why but this end feels different compared to season one. I’d be grateful if you loved and watched until the end. Junki will always be near you guys. Although the drama is ending, please look forward to how the youth of Waikiki will live and what will happen to their relationships.*

* Shin Hyunsoo - *The time has come where the fun times while staying at the guesthouse 'Waikiki' with five friends will become a memory. I’m sad that it’s the end and I already miss it. I think that the viewers who loved ‘Eulachacha Waikiki 2’ probably feel the same way. Please look forward to the direction of the six friends’ dreams and loves, and if Kibong and Yuri can continue secretly dating without getting caught by their friends.*

* Moon Gayoung - *It’s already been six months since I’ve known the ‘Eulachacha Waikiki 2′ team who I met in November of last year. I can’t believe that it’s our last day of filming and it doesn’t feel real. The guesthouse became so familiar that I feel like I’ll have to keep going to it. Thank you for laughing, crying, and sympathizing with us until now. Please be with us until the last episode to see the conclusion of the Waikiki members’ hard efforts until now.*

* Ahn Sohee - *It’s my first project in three years, and I was so happy that I was able to work with a good director, writer, staff, and actors. I thank the many people who helped me from preparing for the project to the time of filming. I think that it was a time where I could grow more. More than anything, I want to say thank you to all of the viewers who tuned in for two months. The stories of the six Waikiki guesthouse troublemakers has not ended yet. Please joyfully tune in until the end with lots of interest and love.*

* Kim Yewon - *I want to really say thank you and that you worked hard to everyone who created 'Eulachacha Waikiki 2’ together. I hope that the ‘Eulachacha Waikiki 2’ characters and the actors who portrayed them will be remembered as a representation of youth that can make viewers smile and give you strength. I shout this to all of the youth in the world. Good luck! Looking back, it wasn’t a long journey, but I think that we all felt ups and downs while watching the different characters and the various sides of youth. Many things will occur to them. Please send cheers and applause to the passion-filled youth of ‘Eulachacha Waikiki 2,’ and I hope you’ll join them for the story of the six characters who are off to a new beginning once again.*

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been a &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/c2Vppob.jpg""&gt;Korean odyssey&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of.

I only watched this show by accident because I expected it to be a Joseon detective show based on the blurb (CSI: Hanyang), which it is not, but by the time I realised this I was hooked.

*Haechi* is hard politics all the way through with a surprising amount of historical accuracy, but you really don’t need to know any actual history to enjoy it, you can pick up everything necessary as you go along with minimal Googling, or just straight up watch it as *Game of Thrones* (the early seasons). The central conflict is the royal succession; the Crown Prince is impotent and the lack of the next heir is the catalyst for endless scheming in the palace for the two main political factions, the Norons and the Sorons. There are three possible candidates in play: Prince Milpoong, the psychopath wild card, the Youngest and goodest legitimate Prince Yeonryeong, and underdog hero Prince Yeoning, who is the son of the King and a water maid, therefore is in a Confucian Schrödinger’s box of being royalty and low-born garbage at the same time. He is helped by the bromantic fellowship of Yeo-ji, a female investigator, Park Mon-soo, an aspiring detective who failed the civil servant exam ten times, and Dal Moon, a beggar who runs a spy network.

The pacing is extremely tight, along the road to the throne the story progresses in mini arcs in which the gang has to solve cases of murder, human trafficking or systematic cheating on exams by the ruling classes. The heroes are earnest, funny and fallible and the acting is stellar all-around, but what stood out for me in particular was the three-dimensionality of the antagonists. Jung Moon-Sung and Lee Kyoung-Young as Prince Milpoong and Noron minister Min Jin-Hun respectively, have done an amazing job with unlikable characters. I cannot recommend it highly enough, even for people like me who would normally fast forward through all the palace intrigue with old beardy guys to get to the romance. I could even tell some of the Old Beards apart by the end and [Min Jin-Hun](https://i.imgur.com/8QCv5fR.png) was my favourite character, this show is just that good. Not gonna lie, the first couple of episodes are super confusing, they’re pretty sink-or-swim with the audience being thrown in the deep end with a huge cast of characters and everyone’s name, title and faction take up half the screen. But stick with it and *Haechi* is utterly rewarding.

&lt;p&gt;The pacing is extremely tight, along the road to the throne the story progresses in mini arcs in which the gang has to solve cases of murder, human trafficking or systematic cheating on exams by the ruling classes. The heroes are earnest, funny and fallible and the acting is stellar all-around, but what stood out for me in particular was the three-dimensionality of the antagonists. Jung Moon-Sung and Lee Kyoung-Young as Prince Milpoong and Noron minister Min Jin-Hun respectively, have done an amazing job with unlikable characters. I cannot recommend it highly enough, even for people like me who would normally fast forward through all the palace intrigue with old beardy guys to get to the romance. I could even tell some of the Old Beards apart by the end and &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/8QCv5fR.png""&gt;Min Jin-Hun&lt;/a&gt; was my favourite character, this show is just that good. Not gonna lie, the first couple of episodes are super confusing, they’re pretty sink-or-swim with the audience being thrown in the deep end with a huge cast of characters and everyone’s name, title and faction take up half the screen. But stick with it and &lt;em&gt;Haechi&lt;/em&gt; is utterly rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Netflix is powerful, merciful. Oh Drama, give me wisdom and make me one with the rightful characters! And the black screen will be brought in front of the eyes of the lost ones! Kocowa is powerful, merciful. Where is that you watched other than Korean dramas? Can it help you, or itself? If you now say: It was the sinful who showed us the wrong drama, could it only be possible to do it all again and watch the right dramas! Viki is powerful, merciful. Then fear the moderators, and obey them! The moderators answered: ""If you do not desist, you will surely be of those who are stoned!"" But most people do not watch. Viu is powerful, merciful. ""And do not obey the order of the transgressors, who cause Western shows to be popular and do not amend."" Together we will find the way to the right drama, through [this website](https://strawpoll.com/7ya479f1)! On the day of the Sun this messenger will give you all the answer!

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our prayers have been answered! Blessed be the nominators! Today on the day of Thor, may he forever carry his hammer in peace, join us in &lt;a href=""https://strawpoll.com/7ya479f1""&gt;the decision&lt;/a&gt; of our next holy writing! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netflix is powerful, merciful. Oh Drama, give me wisdom and make me one with the rightful characters! And the black screen will be brought in front of the eyes of the lost ones! Kocowa is powerful, merciful. Where is that you watched other than Korean dramas? Can it help you, or itself? If you now say: It was the sinful who showed us the wrong drama, could it only be possible to do it all again and watch the right dramas! Viki is powerful, merciful. Then fear the moderators, and obey them! The moderators answered: &amp;quot;If you do not desist, you will surely be of those who are stoned!&amp;quot; But most people do not watch. Viu is powerful, merciful. &amp;quot;And do not obey the order of the transgressors, who cause Western shows to be popular and do not amend.&amp;quot; Together we will find the way to the right drama, through &lt;a href=""https://strawpoll.com/7ya479f1""&gt;this website&lt;/a&gt;! On the day of the Sun this messenger will give you all the answer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAVE ME  SCHEDULE FOR DISCUSSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22599-save-me""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is my dramalist for Save Me, and it is available on &lt;a href=""https://www.viu.com""&gt;Viu&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=""http://www.dramabeans.com/2017/08/rescue-me-episode-1""&gt;The recap&lt;/a&gt; can be read before watching for a safer journey if wanted. It has 16 episodes of 60 minutes.      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday 12th of May eps 14 – 16   and on this day the result of the vote will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; that will convince others to watch it.&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

nothing about this show is normal. from the description, the drama practically had all the tropes i hated: love triangles, jealous characters, rude MLs, and a host of side characters which don't really do much to contribute to the story.

but holy shit, i was just blown away at the insanely amazing character writing and portrayal. a twenty-fucking-four episode jealousy incarnate, in its essence is a story about the daily lives of all these characters, which could've easily turned boring and annoying had it not been for the insane comedy: both the writing and the portrayal by the actors.

i could easily write an appreciation post just for JJS' lee hwa shin. he is easily one of my all time favourite kdrama ML. super realistic, insanely funny, just the perfect amount of cold yet soft and wacky. imo, it was one of the most realistic ML I've seen on tv. from his denial and acceptance of his breast cancer to his professional struggles, there was nothing that was in tune with other traditional male leads. a character which i could've easily hated, his honesty towards dealing with everything around him while protecting his fragile ego won me over. moreover, he wasn't a textbook jerk either. he cared for the people around him, and was a good colleague (his relationship with hye won is easily a fav) and had one of the best growth arcs. he is, by no means, a perfect ML, but if i had to pick i would easily befriend this guy (and date him). JJS' did such a great job as LHS that i didn't want stop my dose of JJS.

GHJ as pyo nari was great. super honest and in touch with her feelings, not conventionally nice, or outspoken, or smart, but easily a person who could be all of these at the correct time and place. i didn't like the bit where she strung along both the guys, but it was comedic gold and was in tune with all of their characters. her and LHS' bickering is easily one of my favourite things the show, from the beginning to the end.

while i don't really have much love for go jung won (he was too perfect for me to ever see him as someone realistic), his role in the story was super important.

i loved the relationship of the moms. watching them go from arch enemies to best friends was the most adorable thing ever. easily one of my favourite female relationships. portrayed with such honesty and a warm heart.

the rest of the cast too did such a heartwarming job, from the nonchalant Oh PD, to the protective dongsaeng chi-yeol, to the suave hye-won, to the friendliest doctor-nurse pair, by the end of the show there wasn't any character i hated.

and oh god the laughs. the show is easily one of the best comedies ever. not just because of its laughing-my-ass-off scenes, but also the subtle comedy dealing with the psyche of the characters and the amazing background music (no no no nooo).

for a story whose main focus in the love triangle and the character development arcs of the various characters, it just nails everything and i hands down haven't seen anything better. a show not meant to be taken seriously, it has amazing moments of truth and if i could erase my memory and watch this all over again, i would.

jealousy incarnate holds a goddamn special place in my heart.

&amp;#x200B;

on that note, what were some other shows that made you feel the same?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;if i had to describe jealousy incarnate in a single word it would be &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;wacky and honest&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing about this show is normal. from the description, the drama practically had all the tropes i hated: love triangles, jealous characters, rude MLs, and a host of side characters which don&amp;#39;t really do much to contribute to the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but holy shit, i was just blown away at the insanely amazing character writing and portrayal. a twenty-fucking-four episode jealousy incarnate, in its essence is a story about the daily lives of all these characters, which could&amp;#39;ve easily turned boring and annoying had it not been for the insane comedy: both the writing and the portrayal by the actors.&lt;/p&gt;

And just like that, Census Season™ is upon us!

Questions and things are right where they should be. Not much planning and editing to do, but I do like to open things up to new ideas we might find useful. 

Remember that this is a survey of demographic, geographic, and basic drama habits. New questions must have responses that are easy to categorize. Favorite Actor/Actress and the like are for our annual subreddit awards.

Take a look at what we had from last year (below). 

##Please do not respond to this post with your census answers. There will be a separate post with a Google form for the actual /r/KDRAMA Census.

#Synopsis

The drama is about Lee Junki (Lee Yikyung), an unpopular actor. He runs the guesthouse Waikiki, but the guest house is facing bankruptcy. To revive the guesthouse, Lee Junki drags his friends Cha Wooshik (Kim Sunho) and Kook Kibong (Shin Hyunsoo), who all graduated from the same high school, to invest in the guesthouse. Suddenly, their first love popped up in front of them!

It is a comic-action-melo-human-youth drama! It portrays the friendship, love, and dreams of the youths!

It’s a good drama to make you laugh, and be in love again.

That part that he said “I’m the last ine standing,” tore my heart.

I thought the romance was cute, but overall the plot was a little boring and too slow-paced for me.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing I couldn't help but notice after I finished the drama was the obvious plot devices written into the drama. The biggest one is Dan-i's daughter. Her only purpose in the entire drama was to create a ""tragic backstory"" for Dan-i, so the viewers can pity her and so it can set up her romance with Eun-ho. That's all fine and good, however, the daughter NEVER SHOWS UP AGAIN. When I finished the drama, I had completely forgotten that she had a daughter. Only until I discussed the drama with someone else did I remember. It's almost like the writers also completely forgot about the daughter after the first few episodes (which is honestly probably what happened). If they were going to have the daughter as a plot device, they should have at least kept it going throughout the rest of the drama. I mean, how can you set up a character as such a hard working mother but not even have her call the daughter (on screen), who's off somewhere studying in the Phillippines (or some other place that I can't remember since it was brought up like once in the entire drama) all by herself. Like seriously, poor kid. It must be hard enough living by herself in a foreign country. But imagine her coming home and suddenly has a new dad. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else also forget that Eun-ho is a professor? What even happened to that? Maybe I erased a scene from my memory but I don't remember him quitting or taking a break. Was it summer break? But anyways, he never worked as a professor ever again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of Eun-ho, he was actually kind of a jerk. Maybe not in the later scenes, but he definitely was one in the beginning. I mean, he went around half-heartedly dating a bunch of girls, probably being really cold to them while they were dating, forcing the girl to break up with him (because of course they had to be the ones dumping him, to make him more likable as a character) after they find out that he doesn't actually care about them, and cares more about his coat getting what than her feelings. Also, he definitely said that he wouldn't push his feelings on to Dan-i... Well that was a blatant lie. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for the other main characters, do they even have families? I vaguely remember Dan-i calling her mother (correct me if I'm wrong), so that must mean she has a mom right? Except if she had other family, why did she have to freeload off her friend for 6 months? I guess her family probably couldn't have helped her, but still. And what's up with Eun-ho's family situation? Is he an orphan? Did a erase another scene from my memory? 

&amp;#x200B;

The real question is, where can I find a friend like Eun-ho who would just let me freeload off of them for 6 months. The thing is, Dan-i obviously felt bad for doing that to Eun-ho (he didn't care though, since he liked her). Except like... did she even feel bad? Now that she has a steady income and a job, couldn't she at least pay for half of the rent and stuff? I mean at this point, she's never gonna need to pay him back, since they're in love and stuff.  

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that the second leads got together... I don't like that. It was way too convenient and just there so everyone can have a ""happily ever after,"" except it's so unnecessary. But whatever, to each their own. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I ended up completely just ranting. The drama wasn't terrible, just had a couple holes and such, and I guess I was pretty picky about it.

In ""Korean Odyssey"" I was very surprised by the depiction of Samsung's CEO.

I mean, in France, businessmen are routinely described as soul-less heart-less bloodsucking corrupted psychopaths, but the depiction of a demon who means ""cleaning the dishes"" when he says ""doing my job"", is ( exquisitely ) offbeat and suggests a lack of deference which,  in France, would not be widely accepted and would be frowned at or dismissed by many people, from all political sides. Basically, insulting powerful people, even ( especially ) the president is common and widely appreciated, as long as it's directly related to their power.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know anything about Korea except what I've seen in Kdramas and it's the first time I notice a direct connection with a real person, and also the first time I see something which might be a lack of deference. Most of the time there is a strong background of respect for the elders, the family and anyone in position of responsability.

&amp;#x200B;

How should be  understood the depiction of this powerful CEO?

How do Koreans understand it? Does it create controversy?

**SAVE ME  SCHEDULE FOR DISCUSSION**

[Here](https://mydramalist.com/22599-save-me) is my dramalist for Save Me, and it is available on [Viu](https://www.viu.com).  [The recap](http://www.dramabeans.com/2017/08/rescue-me-episode-1) can be read before watching for a safer journey if wanted. It has 16 episodes of 60 minutes.      
     
Thursday 9th of May eps 11 – 13    
Sunday 12th of May eps 14 – 16

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sisters and Brethren!

*“Welcome 2 Life” is a fantasy drama that will tell the story about a selfish lawyer who helps people who want to take advantage of the law. One day he gets sucked into a parallel universe due to an unfortunate accident and begins to live a completely new life as an upright prosecutor.*

**Rain** *will be taking on the role of the selfish lawyer Lee Jae Sang. As the ace lawyer from JK Law Firm, one of the nation’s top five law firms, he’s a person who can create something from nothing in order to win. However, due to a traffic accident, he gets sucked into a parallel universe and begins to live life as an upright prosecutor.*

Meanwhile, **Lim Ji Yeon** *will be playing Lee Jae Sang’s ex-girlfriend Ra Si On, a detective who acts before she thinks. Although Ra Si On has a tough personality, she’s also a warm and pure person by nature. After breaking up with Lee Jae Sang 10 years ago, the two are on bad terms. However, in the parallel universe, she’s a bright, energetic, and optimistic working mom who supports Lee Jae Sang with love and trust as his wife.**

In particular, the drastically different chemistry Lee Jae Sang and Ra Si On will portray as exes who are on bad terms in the real world versus the couple that make a fantastic investigative team in the parallel universe will be an interesting comparison to look forward to.

Finally, **Kwak Si Yang** *will be taking on the role of Goo Dong Taek who is Ra Si On’s trusting partner and sunbae. As a police officer from the same police station as Ra Si On, he’s known for his fiery personality, but in actuality, he’s someone soft rather than tough on the inside.*

With the star-studded lineup, “Welcome 2 Life” will broadcast near the end of July and will begin filming once casting is complete. The fantastic new drama will air after the second season of “Partners for Justice” concludes.

This show was very compelling and affecting that I could not contain myself and had to write about it here.

First off, this show has its flaws. The biggest is the numerous long and drawn out scenes with the mothers basically complaining about their husbands and children all day. I think they could've cut several episodes if they minimized the mom chatter without really losing anything from a storytelling standpoint. 

In connection to my main gripe above, I thought it needed more scenes with Deok Sun! She was very charismatic and she was the main draw of this show and I could not get enough of her! I initially found her conflict with Bo Ra incredibly annoying but thank god they brought it down several notches as the show progressed. 

What really fascinated me was the love triangle. Taek and Junghwan's intentions are set in black in white: both love the same girl. However, both of them go differently about dealing with their feelings for her. Taek is special. He is a machine - robotic and forefront about his feelings to his friends and only comes short of being a mindless kitchen appliance by not expressly revealing them to her. 

Junghwan on the other hand, is like most of us. He's extremely hesitant and cowardly. He gives in to peer pressure and pretends to not give a damn about her to avoid ridicule from the gang - especially that rascal Dong Ryon. 

Deok Sun's perspective is the most intriguing in the drama. While Taek and Junghwan were black and white, Deok Sun shifts to gray as the story progresses. In the first half, it was clear she had real romantic feelings for Jong Hwan, and only showed a sisterly love for Taek. Near the end of the show, I was half expecting her to drop a bombshell to Taek about how she only loves him like a brother and that she really loves Junghwan. To viewers' disappointment (including mine), it did not happen. She slowly becomes harder to read as the series went on. Ultimately, Deok Sun really was just a simple, unselfish girl who is generous with her love, and gladly accepts whatever love comes her way. 

What makes this show work and makes it so affecting is the fact that it's told from Junghwan's perspective. He is undoubtedly the hero/protagonist and Taek is the ""villain"". Junghwan was always caring of Deok Sun in the simplest ways like protecting her during bus rides, and waiting for her safe arrival at home. Taek was portrayed to be more of a baby, he received the most care from all the characters (Deok Sun went to great lengths to care for him) and barely gave back (even to his own father) since he was always exhausted from playing Baduk. By the time Taek does give something back, his expression is so plain and emotionless that the audience couldn't get a hold of what he's really feeling or thinking. He was much harder to empathize with than JungHwan in that regard. He appears out of nowhere with robotic and almost ""villainous"" precision to Deok Sun's rescue in several scenes throughout the show, and at a distance there's always Junghwan, longing and hesitating. The camera stays with him and with us. Out of all the characters, JungHwan had the most potential for catharsis and we get a taste of that in the restaurant scene (to the shock of Sun Woo and Dong Ryon) but squandered it by taking it back (poor Deok Sun). He remained a cowardly bitch til the end, which kind of justified the position he was in. Still, I related to him so much more because at some point in our lives we were cowards about confessing our love for somebody and suffered the consequences. 

This series actually has a sad ending (the mood is only uplifted by other aspects of the show: family, growth, nostalgia, and moving on). If you're rooting for Taek, you're missing out on how this show was meant to be experienced. This show is not so much about the facts and the details and examining them like a detective\*, nor is it about picking the right 'team' that will prevail in the end. You are supposed to root for JungHwan from the start, and therefore you are supposed to experience his heartbreak. That feeling of heartbreak is suffocating by the time I finished the show and I found myself smiling and wincing in disbelief. There is only one other movie that gave me the same experience, but only milder: 500 Days of Summer. But unlike an hour and a half movie, this show had an advantage in time. It takes that metaphorical ""Expectations vs Reality"" montage and fleshes it out further. It gives its viewers the unique experience to hijack the mind of Junghwan and become his eyes and witness the romance of Taek and Deok Sun unfold. ""You"" have lost Deok Sun to Taek and this is the suffocating and agonizing aftermath. This show has captured this aspect of heartbreak in spades and I commend the show's producers for that. Bravo. 

To be honest, I did not feel good about how the show ended. I'm disappointed in the sense that I did not get what I expected, but thankful for having experienced a very compelling and affecting story. It's a good metaphor for life perfectly encapsulated by Forrest Gump: ""Life's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.""

\*\*\* When older Deok Sun and Taek were asked when they first kissed and both gave different years (1989 and 1994) - I went back and checked episode 11 when Deok Sun's family was sleeping over at JungHwan's. I was suspecting a flashback that Deok Sun actually kisses Junghwan while he slept before he wakes up and then she proceeds to ask him to take her to the movies. It was also in 1989! So I really thought Deok Sun would end up with Junghwan to my disappointment. lol","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Spoilers ahead boys and girls so look away if you haven&amp;#39;t seen it yet :) )&lt;/p&gt;

It takes that metaphorical &amp;quot;Expectations vs Reality&amp;quot; montage and fleshes it out further. It gives its viewers the unique experience to hijack the mind of Junghwan and become his eyes and witness the romance of Taek and Deok Sun unfold. &amp;quot;You&amp;quot; have lost Deok Sun to Taek and this is the suffocating and agonizing aftermath. This show has captured this aspect of heartbreak in spades and I commend the show&amp;#39;s producers for that. Bravo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I did not feel good about how the show ended. I&amp;#39;m disappointed in the sense that I did not get what I expected, but thankful for having experienced a very compelling and affecting story. It&amp;#39;s a good metaphor for life perfectly encapsulated by Forrest Gump: &amp;quot;Life&amp;#39;s like a box of chocolates. You never know what you&amp;#39;re gonna get.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*** When older Deok Sun and Taek were asked when they first kissed and both gave different years (1989 and 1994) - I went back and checked episode 11 when Deok Sun&amp;#39;s family was sleeping over at JungHwan&amp;#39;s. I was suspecting a flashback that Deok Sun actually kisses Junghwan while he slept before he wakes up and then she proceeds to ask him to take her to the movies. It was also in 1989! So I really thought Deok Sun would end up with Junghwan to my disappointment. lol&lt;/p&gt;

So you know how some Facebook pages post (usually funny) scenes from certain dramas? That’s how my friend and I saw it. These are some of the things I remember from the scene.

     - The setting was medieval Korean, i.e. the characters were wearing traditional clothing.
     - Iirc, the scene in particular, focuses on a girl, which I think is of high ranking, like a princess. There were also servants in the room. Might be eunuchs, I don’t know.
     - The girl (princess?) ordered for attractive men to be lined up inside a room. I can’t recall if they were shirtless lmao, probably?? Probably not.
     - And she picks one from the group of men, which is like the most attractive. Then one of the servants ask her, “How about this one?” While pointing at another attractive guy from the group.
    - Then she takes a second look, smirks, and says, “TAKE HIM TOO!”

It was VERY FUNNY!!!! And I don’t know anything else other than that particular scene. The tone was definitely not serious, it was very comedic. Hope you guys can help me!! Thank you!

**SAVE ME  SCHEDULE FOR DISCUSSION**

[Here](https://mydramalist.com/22599-save-me) is my dramalist for Save Me, and it is available on [Viu](https://www.viu.com).  [The recap](http://www.dramabeans.com/2017/08/rescue-me-episode-1) can be read before watching for a safer journey if wanted. It has 16 episodes of 60 minutes.      

Sunday 5th of May eps 8 – 10      
Thursday 9th of May eps 11 – 13    
Sunday 12th of May eps 14 – 16

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope you are keeping up with us!

Long story short, AutoMod should start flairing posts with our redesign flair templates now. This just saves me time from having to hunt down uncolored flairs. Things should be looking right finally.

*****

Traffic data shows that new reddit people outnumber old reddit people 4 to 1, usually. I have not made any changes to the old reddit look, but I have been trying to maintain CSS and functionality. One of the struggles mods on both systems experience is link flair. 

We use AutoMod to flair some of the pretty regular post classes (On-Air, discussion, preview, etc.) on both systems. Old reddit uses CSS class (where we can customize our flair look with CSS and then just apply it to whatever flairs we want) and new reddit uses flair templates (you select your color, background, etc. by clicking and typing and save that template for use elsewhere). 

Well. There's been an update where Reddit will try to match css_class to template_ID as best it can until old reddit goes away I guess. I missed the mod memo where you can tell AutoMod to include template_ID for redesign flair. There were color and style clashes between flair systems, so the CSS flairs look a bit boring but consistent.

I'll be on the lookout for those flairs that slip through the cracks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

at this stage the male lead hits rock bottom. he becomes penniless. he starts working as a minimum wage employee at his own company"" ... instead of his costly car, he either walks to save money or ride bus. he cant even afford food... his gold digger friends leave him..... his own blood his grandmother says the most hurtful thing about him to his face, how he could never live up to his late father.......... the mighty has totally fallen. he starts working hard to regain his last shred of pride . there are lots of excellent scenes where you will see how the harsh reality of people in real world are affecting him..... the female lead is in charge of a branch and the male lead is working under her...... at this stage when the female lead accuses him why he avoids her, he should be more professional. is he doing that because she stole his inheritance? he just replies politely he avoids her because he is the cause of her losing her brother and she told him that his face reminds her that every time........ the amount of guilty he feels, i was screaming at my computer so that the female leadwould say to him its not his fault......... its her own step mother's fault......but she doesnt tell him

the male lead starts getting good output of his hard work. he does a complete 180. he didnt get better suddenly out of his love for the female lead or whatever . he lets you down several time and then he slowly starts to rebuild himself. it was done so well. people can not change overnight in their adult life. he changed to find his self worth after losing his pride completely. you will feel completely sorry for him at this stagethen there comes a moment where the evil step mother and evil second female lead tells the brilliant perfect lie to the grandmother and the male lead about how the female lead planned it all along to steal the inheritance, how she knew them long before they met her, how she planned it all along.  the lie was so perfect that the female lead leaves their house crying. but the male lead chose to completely trust her!!! it was such a great moment. there is no way he should trust her. this is his opportunity to take back the inheritance. the lie sound so much like truth that the male MC himself know that he shouldnt trust her if he thinks logically. but he chose to believe her!! the evil second female lead is his long time friend but he chose not to believe her lie!! even the female lead got completely baffled at how could he trust her after everything that happened and said

the character development was done so well that the end result was so satisfying to see. here is this guy who transform himself completely. from arrogant rich prick to losing everything completely to rebuild himself up brick by brick....sure it is nice to see the nice second male lead doing adorable things and its very easy to like the ever virtuous good female lead. but pulling off that kind of character development is the hardest and most rewarding thing to see........ when it came to the real test of character, stuck between rock and hard place he chose to take action.

i kind of miss this thing in current dramas. the writers tend to play it safe now a days with the male lead. he is nice and good from the start. at best they become hero from being indifferent.....  or he would get cancelled by the fan ...... i wish they would take more risk and write another transformation story from complete villain to hero......  but i know its very tricky thing to pull off. and if written badly it can completely back fire. there is difference between cocky stupid male lead and this kind of male lead","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its a long post so bear with me....its a relatively older kdrama( from 2009) . i am a fan of lee seung gi so i watched it. it has all the infuriating plot cliche of older kdrama used to have. evil step mom, annoying second female lead, nicest second male lead etc. but still i think it was done in a very entertaining way....i am writing this review because i was absolutely blown away by the character development of the male lead character. now we know that older kdramas used to have an arrogant cold male lead jerk who are highly capable and naive female lead loves him despite that and changes him for better........ this drama doesnt have that. the male lead lee seung gi is absolutely spoiled rich brat kid. he is so spoiled and so incompetent. he is everything that can be wrong with a guy with huge money..... and the show doesnt try to justify it with him being sexy or whatever.... everybody around him talks bad behind him. his grandmother is fed up with him. he is completely a lost cause....... the female lead hates him intensely. she thinks because of him she lost her autistic brother( which isnt true) . and she lets him know that...the female lead here is the paragon of virtue, she is capable , smart and respectful. and due to some circumstances the grandmother of lee seung gi writes her all fortune to the female lead. and female lead accept the inheritance.....so obviously the male lead is infuriated with the female lead for stealing all his fortune. he asked her &amp;quot; you pretend to be so honest and good and constantly berate me for being bad. but even you couldnt resist the temptation of money? &amp;quot;although the male lead hates the female lead for ruining his life , he still kind of respect her and thinks of her highly. so he was let down by that. the female lead had her own reason for agreeing to take the inheritance but she doesnt tell him that, instead she tells him brutally &amp;quot; yes i like money thats why i took it. also i wanted to take everything from you. etc&amp;quot; at this stage you will obviously cheer for the female lead. you will say &amp;quot;yes queen you rock&amp;quot; . you will totally ship the second male lead with the female lead. the story is completely designed for hating on the male lead&lt;/p&gt;

*“Chocolate” will tell the story of a cold-hearted neurosurgeon and a compassionate chef as they comfort each other and heal wounds from their pasts while providing food for hospices. The drama will be a collaborative work by writer Lee Kyung Hee and producing director Lee Hyung Min, who previously worked together for the 2004 hit drama “I’m Sorry, I Love You.”*

Yoon Kye Sang, who will be making his first drama comeback in three years, will play the neurosurgeon Lee Kang. He seems perfect on the outside as he has both looks and brains, but he makes it that much harder for people to approach him.  He used to be a naive boy from a small village near the ocean who dreamed of becoming a chef, but after realizing his uncertain fate, he stats to live a competitive lifestyle.

Yoon Kye Sang stated, “I joined the drama with gratitude because I was told that this was a new drama by director Lee Hyung Min and writer Lee Kyung Hee, both of whom I admire and like. I ask that you show a lot of interest as I will also prepare well in order to best deliver the heartwarming story to viewers.”

Ha Ji Won will also make her long-awaited comeback to the small screen by taking on the role of the chef Moo Cha Young. The chef, who comes from the world of international cooking competitions in Italy, is a huge humanitarian who is full of smiles. However, she does not hold back her anger when she witnesses injustice. Ever since receiving a meal from a boy that she met at a small restaurant from a town near the sea as a young girl, she decided to walk the path to becoming the world-renowned chef.

Ha Ji Won commented, “I’m very glad to be able to join the cast of ‘Chocolate.’ I’m also happy to be meeting director Lee Hyung Min and writer Lee Kyung Hee, with whom I have always wanted to work together.” The actress continued, “As soon as I read the script, I became fond of the drama because it made me feel like I was being comforted through the character Moon Cha Young. I expect that viewers will also be able to feel comfort through the drama.”

The production team of “Chocolate” said, “With the reunion of director Lee Hyung Min and writer Lee Kyung Hee, who have certain ways of telling a story with warmth and details, and the collaboration of Yoon Kye Sang and Ha Ji Won, we hope to create an unparalleled human melodrama. Please anticipate a drama that will touch your heart and bring you comfort.”

“Chocolate” is set to premiere sometime in the second half of this year following the end of “My Country” (literal title).

I just watched ep. 17 (ep. 9 on Netflix) and I was pleasantly surprised by how Ji Wook confessed his feelings for Bong Hee. In most kdrama romcoms I've watched, there was a small chance that the male lead would confess his feelings to the female lead because usually, it's the other way around. And if he does confess, it would be in a way that his cold/arrogant personality would still be there.

The scriptwriters of Suspicious Partner managed to deviate from that norm. Ji Wook's confession was not a simple ""I like you"". He knew that if he confessed to Bong Hee, it would seem as if he was sending her mixed signals because, initially in the drama, he told her not to fall in love with him. This is why he begins his confession by admitting that he was wrong to push her away when he himself had feelings for her. He then says that he likes her, but at the same time, respects her decision to not like him. Finally, he doesn't pressure Bong Hee into responding (he even doesn't force her to like him back); instead, he gives her space to process everything he just said to her.

I'm happy that the scriptwriters didn't make it too dramatic or comedic, and that they made their lead characters mature enough to deal with their love situation.

I just finished \_City Hunter\_ this afternoon, so my thoughts are very fresh.  Also, I realize I am about 8 years late to the party.  Spoilers ahead. 

So, this is my first and probably last viewing of \_City Hunter\_.  I accidentally started celebrating Lee Min Ho’s return by watching \_Boys Over Flowers\_ last weekend, and then was so intrigued by his looks that I started \_City Hunter\_.   This is not a review of \_Boys Over Flowers\_, but I think it is the type of show where one had to be there to really enjoy it.  I watched \_Meteor Garden 2018\_ last summer, and I was so entrenched in those characters that perhaps \_Boys Over Flowers\_ never had a chance with me.

Anyway, \_City Hunter\_ started really strong.  Lee Yoon-sung started off really handsome, daring, and funny.  I love a K-Drama where the lead is a good fighter. (Is that almost all of them?)   I really enjoyed his character in the beginning, and his playful personality.  He pursued Kim Na-Na pretty strong, and she resisted in a very likeable fashion.  However, the show lost me for the romance  when she first professed her love out of nowhere, and then he immediately started pushing her away. This pushing away trope does not belong to \_City Hunter\_ alone this is seems to be very common in K-Dramas, and sometimes it is done really well.  However, I thought it was exhausting in \_City Hunter\_.  He has loved her since he was 17 years old when he only saw her picture, finally meets her, pursues her to like him, and then she falls in love with him and the rest of the show it’s just her begging him to be with her when REVENGE is complete.  I get that he was trying to protect him, but then why pursue her in the first place?

The revenge was very satisfying, and the twist of Lee Yoon-sung being the president’s son was also very good.  I enjoyed all those parts.  Sometimes with the romance part it feels thrown in there and then abandoned because the action part of the story needs to be complete.  

Wae, wae, wae (said in my best Korean) did we only get only one on-screen kiss?  This kiss was hot, and also enjoyable to watch.  I kept thinking there would be more ahead, but nope only one kiss. This is also the part of the story where Lee Yoon-sung’s personality stops being as playful, and starts to become more and more serious.  I liked him more when he was playful.  In his defense, he is finding out really intense information that would be a lot to process, and so the progression of playful young man to serious man is understandable.  

Overall, I give it a 7.5 out of 10 because I didn’t even know it until this show that I needed to see Lee Min-ho in a low v-neck everyday for the rest of my life.  I would have given it a 10, had the ending not been so disappointing.  MORE KISSING PLEASE.  Several points were deducted for just killing of Kim Na-Na’s father in the last 3 minutes.  Personal preference would be that all these types of K-Dramas have a wedding at the end like \_Strong Girl Bong Soon\_ or \_What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim\_.

Well now I am off to watch \_Legend of the Blue Sea\_ to continue my Lee Min-ho return.  Fingers crossed Ji Chang-wook and Lee Min-ho do a show together.  Like a buddy cop thing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just finished _City Hunter_ this afternoon, so my thoughts are very fresh.

He has loved her since he was 17 years old when he only saw her picture, finally meets her, pursues her to like him, and then she falls in love with him and the rest of the show it’s just her begging him to be with her when REVENGE is complete.  I get that he was trying to protect him, but then why pursue her in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The revenge was very satisfying, and the twist of Lee Yoon-sung being the president’s son was also very good.  I enjoyed all those parts.  Sometimes with the romance part it feels thrown in there and then abandoned because the action part of the story needs to be complete.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wae, wae, wae (said in my best Korean) did we only get only one on-screen kiss?  This kiss was hot, and also enjoyable to watch.  I kept thinking there would be more ahead, but nope only one kiss. This is also the part of the story where Lee Yoon-sung’s personality stops being as playful, and starts to become more and more serious.  I liked him more when he was playful.  In his defense, he is finding out really intense information that would be a lot to process, and so the progression of playful young man to serious man is understandable.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I give it a 7.5 out of 10 because I didn’t even know it until this show that I needed to see Lee Min-ho in a low v-neck everyday for the rest of my life.  I would have given it a 10, had the ending not been so disappointing.  MORE KISSING PLEASE.  Several points were deducted for just killing of Kim Na-Na’s father in the last 3 minutes.  Personal preference would be that all these types of K-Dramas have a wedding at the end like _Strong Girl Bong Soon_ or _What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim_.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well now I am off to watch _Legend of the Blue Sea_ to continue my Lee Min-ho return.  Fingers crossed Ji Chang-wook and Lee Min-ho do a show together.  Like a buddy cop thing.&lt;/p&gt;

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drama does not give us a poem a day, but at least we get a song a day.

&lt;p&gt;Kim Soo-Hyun (&lt;a href=""http://asianwiki.com/Chang_Ki-Yong""&gt;Chang Ki-Yong&lt;/a&gt;) is an elite assassin. He kills his targets and disappears. His identity like race, age or name is unknown to others. Individuals, gangs and organizations from all over the world hire Kim Soo-Hyun. Deep within his mind, he wants to have affection from people. Now, Kim Soo-Hyun has to kill to find his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do Hyun-Jin (&lt;a href=""http://asianwiki.com/Nana_(Im_Jin-A""&gt;Nana&lt;/a&gt;)) graduated at the top of her class from a police university. She is an excellent detective who is also arrogant. She is usually dressed fashionably. Do Hyun-Jin comes across as cold-hearted, but she sympathizes with those in painful situations. Now, Do Hyun-Jin chases after Kim Soo-Hyun to reveal a mystery related to her lover&amp;#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;

Now that I've been rewatching it this past month, it makes even less sense to me, so I'm looking to get some insight from anyone who feels like Chilbong was the better match for Najung.

From the very start, we see how much Trash cares for Najung in all the little and big things he does for her. The episode of her biological brother's death anniversary is a perfect example of it (and also what really sold me to them permanently): the way he does some of the household tasks without making a big fuss of it just so Najung would go rest, how he worries over her the whole day and keeps an ear/eye out for her, and of course, him buying her the stuffed seal that looks almost identical to the one she had in her childhood. In that moment, Trash was the only one to know and understand what Najung was going through, and what to do to help relieve her of some of the heaviness she was feeling. Obviously, that's due to them having known each other for a long time, but to me that just solidifies the strength in their relationship: they have history. Their relationship was founded on years of knowing each other inside and out; they knew each other's quirks, admired each other's strengths, and accepted all their flaws.

On the other hand, there was just never any depth to Chilbong and Najung's romantic relationship. I remember worrying when the show was airing live that the writers were gonna cave to the boatloads of Chilbong fanatics (while there are dozens of us Trash die-hards! DOZENS!), but now, in retrospect, there really was never any doubt. Not once did Najung ever show to reciprocate Chilbong's feelings. Her fault I guess is that she never rejected him point blank until the final episode (which, I mean...is for dramatic purposes, but still), but it was always obvious that the only one she loves is Trash. All we ever saw was Chilbong pining away for Najung, but we never actually got to see them bond in any meaningful way that could count as more than platonic. She'd tutor him or go to his games or hang out with him, even sob about him potentially dying in the Sampoong collapse, but those were all things she was willing to do for any of her other friends. Part of Najung's character is that she goes the extra mile for the people she cares about, but the only person she'd go to the ends of the earth for was Trash.

I also resent the implication that Trash only started liking Najung because Chilbong liked her. Throughout that whole episode, Trash repeatedly said that he does reciprocate Najung's feelings, but was just afraid of ruining the relationship he had with her parents (which is what happened when they did break up, so it wasn't unwarranted). It is true that Chilbong telling him how he feels was the catalyst for Trash to confess, but it's not because of some sort of male possessiveness that I see some people endorse. Trash just realized in that moment that although he feared ruining his relationship with Najung's parents, he still feared losing Najung, the person he loved, the person who loved him back, more.

Outside of the romance itself, Chilbong just wasn't a compelling character to me. I've seen people's chief complaint be that Chilbong's whole arc revolved around Najung and nothing else, which is why it confuses me when the same people go hard for Chilbong to be Najung's husband. To me, the fact that Chilbong by himself wasn't a well-rounded character was one of the reasons why I don't think him and Najung were endgame material. Trash and Najung were both multifaceted characters, and so seeing their progression together as a couple was what made their relationship very realistic for me.

This got too long and it isn't even half of what I want to say lol, but I just wanted to rant. I know this post itself is romance centric, but I did and still do genuinely enjoy Reply 1994 as a drama. It had so much heart and warmth, the most out of all the Reply series imo, so it kind of grinds my gears because I feel like people put this installment at the end of their list simply because Najung didn't end up with Chilbong. The show's now just reduced to ""the Reply series where second lead syndrome was strong uwu"", which annoys me because 1) [Kelly Kapoor voice] how dare you? Reply 1994 was an amazing show, and 2) I don't understand what there would be a second lead syndrome about. I understand the gripes over Chilbong being underdeveloped/thrown to the wolf boys, because I was disappointed of that myself (he was just such a pitiful person from beginning to end imo, like give the guy a break), but most of the grievances people have is really that Chilbong didn't get the love of his life Najung (completely ignoring the fact that Najung loved Trash, and Trash loved her back, so…).

Anyways, tl;dr: Trash was an amazing character, Trash/Najung was an amazing couple, Reply 1994 was an amazing series, and people need to put some respek on all their names and stop reducing the show's worth to the fact that Chilbong and Najung didn't end up together. (Also, to be petty, I thought Trash was more attractive than Chilbong, so if I see any of y'all say, ""yeah, but Trash was so ugly/Chilbong was so hot!"", I'm gonna throw a goat.)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I watched Reply 1994 while it was originally airing, and never understood the love for the Chilbong/Najung ship, to the point where people denigrate Trash&amp;#39;s character/importance in Najung&amp;#39;s life.

I remember worrying when the show was airing live that the writers were gonna cave to the boatloads of Chilbong fanatics (while there are dozens of us Trash die-hards! DOZENS!), but now, in retrospect, there really was never any doubt. Not once did Najung ever show to reciprocate Chilbong&amp;#39;s feelings. Her fault I guess is that she never rejected him point blank until the final episode (which, I mean...is for dramatic purposes, but still), but it was always obvious that the only one she loves is Trash. All we ever saw was Chilbong pining away for Najung, but we never actually got to see them bond in any meaningful way that could count as more than platonic. She&amp;#39;d tutor him or go to his games or hang out with him, even sob about him potentially dying in the Sampoong collapse, but those were all things she was willing to do for any of her other friends. Part of Najung&amp;#39;s character is that she goes the extra mile for the people she cares about, but the only person she&amp;#39;d go to the ends of the earth for was Trash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also resent the implication that Trash only started liking Najung because Chilbong liked her. Throughout that whole episode, Trash repeatedly said that he does reciprocate Najung&amp;#39;s feelings, but was just afraid of ruining the relationship he had with her parents (which is what happened when they did break up, so it wasn&amp;#39;t unwarranted). It is true that Chilbong telling him how he feels was the catalyst for Trash to confess, but it&amp;#39;s not because of some sort of male possessiveness that I see some people endorse. Trash just realized in that moment that although he feared ruining his relationship with Najung&amp;#39;s parents, he still feared losing Najung, the person he loved, the person who loved him back, more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of the romance itself, Chilbong just wasn&amp;#39;t a compelling character to me. I&amp;#39;ve seen people&amp;#39;s chief complaint be that Chilbong&amp;#39;s whole arc revolved around Najung and nothing else, which is why it confuses me when the same people go hard for Chilbong to be Najung&amp;#39;s husband. To me, the fact that Chilbong by himself wasn&amp;#39;t a well-rounded character was one of the reasons why I don&amp;#39;t think him and Najung were endgame material. Trash and Najung were both multifaceted characters, and so seeing their progression together as a couple was what made their relationship very realistic for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This got too long and it isn&amp;#39;t even half of what I want to say lol, but I just wanted to rant. I know this post itself is romance centric, but I did and still do genuinely enjoy Reply 1994 as a drama. It had so much heart and warmth, the most out of all the Reply series imo, so it kind of grinds my gears because I feel like people put this installment at the end of their list simply because Najung didn&amp;#39;t end up with Chilbong. The show&amp;#39;s now just reduced to &amp;quot;the Reply series where second lead syndrome was strong uwu&amp;quot;, which annoys me because 1) [Kelly Kapoor voice] how dare you? Reply 1994 was an amazing show, and 2) I don&amp;#39;t understand what there would be a second lead syndrome about. I understand the gripes over Chilbong being underdeveloped/thrown to the wolf boys, because I was disappointed of that myself (he was just such a pitiful person from beginning to end imo, like give the guy a break), but most of the grievances people have is really that Chilbong didn&amp;#39;t get the love of his life Najung (completely ignoring the fact that Najung loved Trash, and Trash loved her back, so…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, tl;dr: Trash was an amazing character, Trash/Najung was an amazing couple, Reply 1994 was an amazing series, and people need to put some respek on all their names and stop reducing the show&amp;#39;s worth to the fact that Chilbong and Najung didn&amp;#39;t end up together. (Also, to be petty, I thought Trash was more attractive than Chilbong, so if I see any of y&amp;#39;all say, &amp;quot;yeah, but Trash was so ugly/Chilbong was so hot!&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m gonna throw a goat.)&lt;/p&gt;

BUT I FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CANNOT STAND SOON AE.

in this episode, even after the chef confesses his love for bong-sun she continues to inhabit the body even during the day (when there is absolutely no chance of any sex) and keeps pushing him for sex even though he clearly says he doesn't want to do it YET.

in the first few episodes it was kinda funny her advances and everything, but as a girlfriend (or someone who pretends to be his girlfriend) she really should be more understanding.

ok i get it that she doesn't wanna leave with a grudge and is literally dead and lonely so the only thing she can do is have sex with this guy to ascend to the other world.

BUT OMG IT MADE ME SO UNCOMFORTABLE AND SAD THAT HE EVEN HAD TO ASK HER IF SHE WAS THERE FOR HIS BODY. LIKE THE REAL BONG SUN ACTUALLY LIKES HIM AS A PERSON BUT THIS GIRL FOR HER OWN REASONS IS NOT ONLY PORTRAYING THIS WEIRD IMAGE OF BONG SUN BUT ALSO COMING OFF AS IMMENSELY UNATTRACTIVE.

if my boyfriend pushed me for sex this way just a day after we started dating, i'd reconsider.

ugh it makes me so uncomfortable. plus when she stopped bong sun from looking at him even though they haven't interacted as each other all day AFTER SHE GOES OUT WITH HER MAN AND FIGHTS WITH HIM just makes me mad.

literally all i want is the cute bong sun to go on dates with her man and blush over him and do other cute stuff, but this is not what i signed up for. seriously making me reconsider giving this show time if this continues. does it stay the same for the coming 6 episodes too? ugh

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you were traumatised by the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), photographs of your Chilsung Cider can collection, real life cult escape stories, a collection of help line numbers for those in need, haikus about how creepy the characters are, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a short break we are starting again with the heaviest drama I could think of nominating, &lt;a href=""http://asianwiki.com/Save_Me""&gt;Save me&lt;/a&gt;.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

You know the type. This girl is not realistic. That’s why I love Hae Young. Is she emotional? Yes. Does she say what she thinks? More than most people which is admirable.

I really hate shows with perfect heroines who experience every hardship under the sun and are martyrs about it. The  girls who subsist on part time jobs but are always plucky and perky. You know the type. This girl is not realistic. That’s why I love Hae Young. Is she emotional? Yes. Does she say what she thinks? More than most people which is admirable. Does she ugly cry when bad things happen? Absolutely. Who wouldn’t in her shoes? She still manages to overcome like most heroines do, but she doesn’t pretend that everything is ok either.

FL eventually get her MIL to consent to her working. She gets a job at a cosmetics company, where there is a spoiled rich brat who is the CEO's son. FL ends up saving him from some falling crates, though he can't remember who saved him. FL's SIL decides to use this to get the son to fall in love with her by pretending to be the one who saved him.

What I noticed is that there are a lot of multiseasonal dramas that will air this year. Here are a few dramas and their changes:

* KBS' Queen of Mystery 2 - same writer, leads Kwon Sangwoo and Choi Kanghee remains but different director and supp. actors. *finished*

* KBS' My Lawyer, Mr. Jo 2: Crime and Punishment - Park Shinyang remains but different casts and/or staffs. *finished*

* JTBC's Eulachacha Waikiki 2 - same staffs, different casts except Lee Yikyung. *ongoing*

* Naver's A-Teen 2 - majority of the main casts remain except Shin Yeeun and Shin Seungho that will reprising their roles in S2 as guest stars. Bomin and Jo Youngin joins the main cast as new characters. *airs on April 25th*

* OCN's Save Me 2 - same writer but different casts and director. *airs on May 8th*

* OCN's Voice 3 - same casts, writer but different director. *airs on May 11th*

* MBC's Partners for Justice 2 - same director, writers, leads Jung Jaeyoung and Jung Yoomi remains but Lee Yikyung, Stephanie Lee and Park Eunseok won't returning. Oh Manseok and No Minwoo joins the main cast as new characters. *airs on June 2019*

Not all multiseasonal dramas are perfect and there is *always* a flaw when it comes to S2, and I think it's the trend today in KDramas?

""Mr. Temporary"" (both literal translation).

The drama is about a murder that takes place at an elite high school. Although the school is in the top 0.1 percent of all schools in the country, many dangerous crimes are committed there without being properly punished because the students are minors.

A source from the drama confirmed the casting news for these four actors and said, “Based on their talent and their high level of synchronization with the characters, we expect them to have great synergy together. Look forward to the thrilling catharsis that they will bring to the small screen.”

**Yoon Kyun Sang** (*Clean with Passion for Now*) will play the role of Gi Moo Hyuk, a lawyer who goes undercover as a temporary teacher at an elite school. Gi Moo Hyuk is materialistic and only cares about money, but when he loses everything, he is forced to go undercover in order to reveal the truth behind this prestigious school.

**Geum Sae Rok** (*The Fiery Priest, Marry Me Now*) will play the role of Ha So Yeon, a passionate physical education teacher who believes in her students no matter what.

**Lee Joon Young (U-KISS Jun)** (*Goodbye to Goodbye, Avengers Social Club*) will play the role of Yoo Beom Jin, a top student at the school who seems perfect in every way.

**Choi Yoo Hwa** (*Life, Suits*) will play the ace prosecutor Cha Hyun Jung, who has been rivals with Gi Moo Hyuk since their days at the Judicial Research and Training Institute.

Mr. Fixed Term” will air after “Save Me 2” finishes its run in July.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. 

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

* Please make sure you are using spoiler tags when discussing important plot details and other information. You can find the guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags).

* Things like italics, headings, and table formatting are done using markdown.

Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it&amp;#39;s best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There&amp;#39;s no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That&amp;#39;s where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Each episode will show patients whose source of pain is unknown and patients that suffer from chronic illnesses as the doctors pursue the unknown causes of their pain. It will also tackle the debate surrounding the controversial practice of euthanasia.

Ji Sung will be playing genius doctor Cha Yo Han, the youngest anesthesiology professor. Lee Se Young will be playing Kang Si Young, a resident anesthesiologist. This will be her first medical drama. Lee Kyu Hyung will be playing Son Suk Ki, a prosecutor at the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office.

The drama will be directed by Jo Soo Won (“I Hear Your Voice,” “Pinocchio,” “Thirty But Seventeen“) and written by Kim Ji Woon (“Cheongdam-dong Alice,” “Hyde, Jekyll, Me“).

“Doctor Room” is slated to air in July after “Nokdu Flower.”

It is the first KDrama I've seen and I'm glad I started with it because now I want to watch more KDramas! The character development, casting, chemistry and plot were all amazing! I wish I could say it's a 100% masterpiece but.....I have some thoughts. 

The show for the first 10 episodes was great, Eun was so cute, goofy and innocent. She had a tragic past and her aunt made it even more disgusting. I loved the small and awkward interactions Eun and Shin had for the start. And the bromance between Shin and Wang, the love/hate to love/love was so nice. And their acting made it even more perfect. I felt like I was in a fantasy myself watching this funny, cute and lovely show. But then it started becoming a bit bs.

Why was Park so strong that a Goblin and a Reaper couldn't harm him even a bit? Was a bit stupidly overpowered, for a mere demon/ghost. After Shin sacrificed himself for Eun, I was annoyed by the damn memory wipe which removed him and his 900 year old memories from everyone in history. It's like it was all a waste, but I didn't mind that too much, it helped the plot further on. The real big bs was the 9 YEAR time skip...............9 whole years. Eun was alone, Sunny was alone, everyone was split apart. They didn't need to be split for that long. They missed 9 years of their life pretty much, because their worlds revolved around one another. So they lived like robots for 9 years. Reaper should've stayed in touch with Eun at least. And the time skip should've been shorter. 3-4 years, especially if they wanted to kill off Eun -\_- They could have made so many more memories until her 29th year in peace. Eun's prime years were wasted. The best part of the show was her goofiness and innocent moments with Shin plus the rest of the gang! It was so heartwarming and lovable, only time I enjoyed ""slice of life"" content in my life. I wanted more of her like that but they just time skip to 29 when she's a woman. It was so weird.

In all honesty, I got over the 9 year bs and memory wipe after Shin came back and all was normal again. They were one big happy family. But then more followed. They got married without Sunny, Reaper, Hwa or any of their friends. Something that Eun longed for her whole life, they should've been there with them. It also felt insanely rushed that they went from the buckwheat marriage to the table celebration and singing. And that is where the show should have ENDED! It was such a happy and perfect moment. Even though reaper and sunny weren't together yet I could have lived with it if they showed the future memory Shin saw and ended it. Because it showed they end up happy and together. But no. The writer just went ahead and butchered this beautiful drama.

Why didn't Reaper stop time and call Shin to tell him to come and save Eun? Or why didn't he go and stand in front of the Truck or even stop time and take Eun out of the car after she stopped it. There was no reason for her to die at all. Wowie you wanted to show that humans can control destiny, well WE ALREADY SAW THAT WHEN SHIN CAME BACK! Eun did NOT have to die! Especially after Shin only just came back from Limbo, 9 years wasted alone and then she just dies after being reunited. How could the legendary and powerful Goblin not do anything to save her? Just because the mark faded you're telling me he won't be summoned by her when in danger? But apparently she can still do the candle summon? Lol, if anything it would make sense if the candle thing was over and only danger worked.

Eun's death made the whole drama feel like a waste of time. The plot for the first 13 eps, a waste of time. The whole ""Shin must die or Eun will"" stuff was worthless. They both die and Shin has to be stuck all alone forever AGAIN! We spent the first 13 eps crying and cheering for nothing. I would have been happier if they just made Shin go to heaven instead and then Eun dies and meets him at the reapers tea house where he would've been waiting. The writer tried to give us a tragic, bittersweet ending, but I feel it was completely unnecessary and cruel. It left me feeling empty, heartbroken and most of all depressed. Severely depressed.

There were other options too like making Eun immortal so she can live forever with Shin. Reaper and Sunny's part can stay the same because it was perfect, they can both go to heaven like the original ending. Or Shin becomes mortal and dies with Eun, which would have been even more perfect. Because it was Eun's 1st life, it could have also been Shin's 1st life. Or just leave the story at the marriage like I said before and we could have been left to interpret their fates. Whether Shin became mortal or Eun immortal and we had closure on Sunny and Reaper because of the flash forward already. It was perfect.

If I ever rewatch this again, which I probably will because of the beautiful OST, cast and chemistry, then I'm stopping at the marriage lol. No need to cause myself to be disappointed and depressed ever again. To think I was almost brought to tears during the watch through just to be played with like a toy at the end. Disgusting.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: And did Sunny and Reaper retain their memories because they didn't show them drinking the tea? So what about that even. And the fact that Hwa, one of the side MC's didn't get a future cameo was crazy, although it might have been the guy calling shin Naeuri.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I just finished Goblin and it is probably the best drama I&amp;#39;ve ever seen, top 3 all time. It is the first KDrama I&amp;#39;ve seen and I&amp;#39;m glad I started with it because now I want to watch more KDramas! The character development, casting, chemistry and plot were all amazing! I wish I could say it&amp;#39;s a 100% masterpiece but.....I have some thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show for the first 10 episodes was great, Eun was so cute, goofy and innocent. She had a tragic past and her aunt made it even more disgusting. I loved the small and awkward interactions Eun and Shin had for the start. And the bromance between Shin and Wang, the love/hate to love/love was so nice. And their acting made it even more perfect. I felt like I was in a fantasy myself watching this funny, cute and lovely show. But then it started becoming a bit bs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why was Park so strong that a Goblin and a Reaper couldn&amp;#39;t harm him even a bit? Was a bit stupidly overpowered, for a mere demon/ghost. After Shin sacrificed himself for Eun, I was annoyed by the damn memory wipe which removed him and his 900 year old memories from everyone in history. It&amp;#39;s like it was all a waste, but I didn&amp;#39;t mind that too much, it helped the plot further on. The real big bs was the 9 YEAR time skip...............9 whole years. Eun was alone, Sunny was alone, everyone was split apart. They didn&amp;#39;t need to be split for that long. They missed 9 years of their life pretty much, because their worlds revolved around one another. So they lived like robots for 9 years. Reaper should&amp;#39;ve stayed in touch with Eun at least. And the time skip should&amp;#39;ve been shorter. 3-4 years, especially if they wanted to kill off Eun -_- They could have made so many more memories until her 29th year in peace. Eun&amp;#39;s prime years were wasted. The best part of the show was her goofiness and innocent moments with Shin plus the rest of the gang! It was so heartwarming and lovable, only time I enjoyed &amp;quot;slice of life&amp;quot; content in my life. I wanted more of her like that but they just time skip to 29 when she&amp;#39;s a woman. It was so weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I got over the 9 year bs and memory wipe after Shin came back and all was normal again. They were one big happy family. But then more followed. They got married without Sunny, Reaper, Hwa or any of their friends. Something that Eun longed for her whole life, they should&amp;#39;ve been there with them. It also felt insanely rushed that they went from the buckwheat marriage to the table celebration and singing. And that is where the show should have ENDED! It was such a happy and perfect moment. Even though reaper and sunny weren&amp;#39;t together yet I could have lived with it if they showed the future memory Shin saw and ended it. Because it showed they end up happy and together. But no.

I am intressed in who you think has the most consistency in partaking in good dramas, either through picking good scripts or carrying flawed scripts. I asked myself this question and the first actor/actress to come to mind was Lee Jong Suk, although I would love to hear your opinion on the matter since I might be missing someone or our tastes might wildly differ. However, I would still like to argue that Lee Jong Suk is up there in terms of partaking in highly rated and popular dramas. Let's take a look at some of the hit dramas he has been in:

Secret Garden (although having a smaller role)

School 2013

I Hear Your Voice

Pinocchio

W

While You Were Sleeping

The Hymn of Death

Romance is a Bonus Book

&amp;#x200B;

The dramas he has been in that I see could lower his consitency would be:

Prosecutor princess (also a minor role)

Doctor Stranger (did not really feel this drama)

7 first kisses (if you even want to call this a drama, it's more of a commercial)

SAVE ME  SCHEDULE FOR DISCUSSION

[Here](https://mydramalist.com/22599-save-me) is my dramalist for Save Me, and it is available on [Viu](https://www.viu.com). It has 16 episodes of 60 minutes. We are going to take a break over Easter, so the schedule will be:     

Thursdag 25th of April eps 1 – 2         
Sunday 28th of April eps 3 - 4      
Thursday 2nd of May eps 5 – 7      
Sunday 5th of May eps 8 – 10      
Thursday 9th of May eps 11 – 13    
Sunday 12th of May eps 14 – 16   

Nominations will be on Sunday May 5th and voting on May 9th. 

I can't really say ""Hope you enjoy"" about this drama, so I will just say ""I hope you will hold my hand while I watch and come with sharp analysis of why things are happening or tell us your story with a cult or just give us some uplifting news.

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you loved the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), your best housekeeping tips, anecdotes about times you've been suspicious of others, haikus about your feels, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are saying good bye to the robotic housekeepers and entering even more scary territory.

I apologize that this is a movie, not a drama. I wasn't sure where else to ask.

3-4 years ago, I watched a Korean movie on either Netflix or Hulu. It was around the time that You're My Pet was one of the other movies available. It was suggested as similar. The first part seemed like a normal romance movie with the boyfriend ultimately proposing to the girl. It was pretty generic.

At some point, an old lady goes missing, and the main character starts to suspect her fiancé. I think she does some investigating, and it turns out to be a big misunderstanding. I remember something about her going to the old lady's house and finding plane tickets and a suitcase. 

Somehow she ends up tied up in a basement somewhere. It turns out that her fiancé really IS a murderer and killed the old lady. She spends the rest of the movie trying to get away from him. She might shoot or stab him at one point and thinks he's dead, but he's not. I think he may actually end up killing her in the end.

I can't remember the name of it for the life of me, and I've been dying to watch it again!

As searching for others' comments about this series, I see a lot of people hate and even despise the character Ta Hwan. I find this unfair. 

First, people hate him because of his cowardliness, and compare him to the ideal man Wang Yoo. In the very beginning of building these 2 characters, Wang Yoo was favored with all the advantages of personality that a person needs, while Ta Hwan struggled the whole series, and whole life, to become a better self. He was mentally abused from young age, not even his mother protected him. No need to say, people form their characters in early years of life. If a person was hurt from childhood, the pain can haunt him his whole life. Did he live his royal life happily and peacefully? He was always in pain and loneliness and had no way out. I felt how much was that pain. It was so heartbroken. If Yang Yi and Wang Yoo fought with outside enemies, Ta Hwan fought with himself. He really wanted to become better. It's a good thing about him that we should recognize. His development was slow and difficult. Sometimes I was disappointed in him (when he betrayed Seyungyang the first time). Sometimes I was heartbroken and worried for him when he fell (when he became a drunker and deluded that everyone laughs at him). But after all, he improved: he stood up against Yeon Chul, handled national affairs himself, and finally caught the rebel enemies himself instead of asking Yang Yi to do it, even continued to drink poison. I don't see him as an Emperor, but a normal person tried to be a good Emperor as best as he can.   


Second, people hate him because he killed Wang Yoo. This plot is the reason that he gets even more hatred from the audiences, which showed that he couldn't overcome his insecurity. He failed to overcome himself. That's such a pity! But there's something absurd about this plot. Wang Yoo was a very clever man who fooled the fox Yeon Chul to death, had the great ability to convince and negotiate with enemies. He himself knew well that he would never reveal a secret that would harm the love of his life. He cared for his country. Therefore, he should have done something to save his life instead of threw it away in the hand of the Emperor. Now, if a wise man as Wang Yoo agreed that his life is a danger to Yang Yi, isn't it right for Ta Hwan to kill him (even though the way he killed Wang Yoo wasn't very nice)? And if it was wrong to kill Wang Yoo, didn't the wise man suddenly become a fool? We can see this isn't a good plot. Therefore, the one to blame here isn't the characters anymore, but the writers. If the audiences hate Ta Hwan because of this, I find it very unfair. 

Finally, people hate him because he raped Yang Yi.  This was the point when he fell. Desperately and painfully, when he yelled at her, it was like he was begging. In the end, their clothes were still intact. It was hard to say if he really raped her or not. But as I said from the beginning, I understand him, I don't blame him for this. This is the only thing I can't defend him.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve just finished watching Empress Ki this morning and my feeling for it hasn&amp;#39;t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Solid 8/10 in my opinion. 

I love that:

1. Jang Nara and Jang Hyuk have insane chemistry. Their acting, art, craft, and the hear they put into the show is phenomenal. Never doubted fact that the OTP was truly fated to love each other. I'm a young guy who usually does not cry or get too sappy when watching dramas (especially rom-coms) but there were definitely scenes with them where I cried. 
2. Jang Nara is super pretty, and super cute with the glasses. I know she has a reputation of having ""eternal youth"" but o m g I cannot believe she was 33 when she did this drama, she could easily pass off as early-mid 20s. And her character too - I felt she conveyed the sense of insecurity, vulnerability, and lack of confidence but with a big kind heart for the early parts of Miyoung's character, and that did evolve into stronger confidence as time went by.
3. How can you forget Gun's laugh? Easily the most memorable laugh in Kdrama land I feel. Jang Hyuk's acting was amazing as well. 
4. OST is amazing. It's probably overshadowed by its contemporary's (It's Okay, That's Love) legendary OST, but the OST tracks were no slouch. I loved how Baek A Yeon's ""Morning of Canon"" had a whimsical, somewhat bittersweet sound that really reflected the OTP's relationship. And of course, Ailee's ""Goodbye My Love"" was an amazingly heartbreaking piece. 
5. I enjoyed that there was not too much love triangle / 2nd lead syndrome in the show. Sorry Choi Jinhyuk, you didn't really stand a chance at all

The not so lovely:

1. &gt;!Noble Idiocy ruined a star for this show. The drama was clearly paced for 16 episodes, but at 20 episodes the whole plot line of Gun's disease and subsequent fallout really felt like angsty filler that contrasted heavily with the lighter tones of the drama. And it didn't even matter that much at the end! !&lt;
2. &gt;!Plot and character development for the second leads I felt was a bit lacking. Especially Sera's character and how her relationships with her mom and how she came to accept Daniel as her brother.!&lt;

Overall, extremely wholesome, well-intended drama that couple chemistry drove almost throughout. In comparison to my flaired drama (Queen In-hyun's Man) I think the plot, writing, and stakes involved in the latter puts it a notch above Fated To Love You, but this is definitely a drama that I feel empty and a void needs to be filled after finishing. Going through some serious drama withdrawal right now.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just finished watching the 2014 Korean Remake of &amp;quot;Fated To Loved You&amp;quot; and boy it is easily one of my favorite Kdrama rom-coms of all time.

Six flying dragons is very long, so if it wins we will have to do **8 hours of dramawatching a week**. It is available on Viki Norway, probably also in other countries in Europe. Maybe on Netflix US? It is your responsibility to check if it is available in your country. 

Save me is available on Viu Singapore and possibly other places too.

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you loved the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), your best housekeeping tips, anecdotes about times you've been suspicious of others, haikus about your feels, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

**Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.**","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several people are in a drama slump, or busy, so we might close down for a month.

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**.

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

This will be comeback drama for Moon Geun Young, since 2015 SBS drama ""The Village: Achiara's Secret"".

**Moon Geun Young** will be playing the overzealous rookie detective Yoo Ryung, who can’t stop herself when it comes to injustice. She solves cases with her overflowing sense of justice and exceptional spatial perception but always gets herself into trouble because of her rash actions. She meets Go Ji Suk, which will be played by **Kim Sun Ho** (*Eulachacha Waikiki 2*)**,** a man who avoids cases and seeks stability. However, he always ends up cleaning up after the problems caused by Yoo Ryung and holds the key to the solving the cases.

He has been a detective for Wangsimni Subway Police for three years and is the chief of Investigative Team One. He entered the homicide department after graduating from the police academy, but he changed his dreams after becoming the guardian for his single mother who gets diagnosed with dementia. While living life as a police officer who oversees procedures and regulations instead of a cop that catches bad people, his life begins anew when he meets her.

Moon Geun Young rose to fame as a child actress for her part in “Autumn In My Heart,” after which she was nicknamed the “nation’s little sister.” Since then, she continued to appear in dramas such as “Empress Myeongseong” and films such as “A Tale of Two Sisters” and “My Little Bride.” In 2008, she was the youngest recipient ever to receive a SBS Daesang award for her drama “Painter of the Wind.” She has continued with an impressive filmography including dramas “Cinderella’s Sister,” “Goddess of Fire,” and films “The Throne,” “Glass Garden,” and more.

Kim Sun Ho became well-known to the public through 2017 KBS drama “Chief Kim,” and he continued to showcase his acting skills by taking on roles in “Strongest Deliveryman,” “Two Cops,” “You Drive Me Crazy,” “100 Days My Prince,” and more. After wrapping up his work in “Welcome to Waikiki 2,” he will move on to “Catch Yoo Ryung.”

“Catch Yoo Ryung” will be directed by Shin Yoon Sub PD, who previously directed “*Rooftop Prince*,” “*Ugly Alert*,” and “*Please Come Back, Mister*.” It is slated to air in the latter half of the year.

The drama is about Lee Junki (Lee Yikyung), an unpopular actor. He runs the guesthouse Waikiki, but the guest house is facing bankruptcy.

“Watcher” will be a psychological thriller that follows three people whose lives are destroyed by a tragic accident as they become a team that uncovers corruption and fights against people with power. With an interesting premise of good cops catching bad cops, the drama will talk about the various facets of humanity in a new way.

Han Suk Kyu (*Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim*) will play the role of Do Chi Kwang, the head of the anti-corruption team. He was a thoughtful, elite police officer who felt pride in catching the bad guys but after a series of events, he uncovers corruption in the police force and realizes the importance of internal monitoring, and he becomes the col and exact team leader who doesn’t let personal relationships cloud his judgment.

Seo Kang Joon (*The Third Charm*) will play Kim Young Goon, a motor patrol officer. Though he is a warm and affectionate person, he hides all of that at his job and acts cold and distant. He had applied to work as a motor patrol officer because he wanted to work alone, and by chance, he meets Do Chi Kwang, who has something to do with something that happened to him in the past. Though Kim Young Goon had tried to erase his shocking past, meeting Do Chi Kwang leads him to join the anti-corruption team to find the truth.

With them will be Kim Hyun Joo, who will play the popular lawyer Han Tae Joo. After being admitted to the police academy, she changed paths to become an elite prosecutor. During her career as a prosecutor, an investigation she got involved in went too far and she almost lost her life in the process. Since then, she has set up her own private law firm after quitting her job as a prosecutor, and fate leads her to the anti-corruption team.

The production staff stated, “‘Watcher’ will be a psychological thriller that follows the duality of human beings through various investigations. This drama has been in the works for over two years, and we are doing our best to create the greatest drama. Han Suk Kyu, Seo Kang Joon, and Kim Hyun Joo will play characters they have never played before, so please anticipate it.”

“Watcher” will be directed by Ahn Gil Ho, who worked on “Memories of the Alhambra” and “Stranger"", and the script will be written by Han Sang Woon, who wrote “The Good Wife.” The drama is set to begin airing in the second half of the year.

First of all...THAT ENDING THOUGH!!!! (Just going to leave it at that). The k drama is a 3 episodes long so this drama would perfect for when you need to spend a few hours. The acting is amazing and the chemistry between the actors and characters is also amazing!  Since I don’t know really any historical info about Korea and Japan, it might be helpful to know some facts during the 1920s about Korea and Japan.(something is happening between Japan and Korea. They don’t give you any info. Probably learn about in class if from Korea) I love it’s based on a true story! I don’t know how accurate it is to the true story but it’s a good drama itself!

WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you loved the drama, episodic notes, all the links from all Kim Tan bot approved sources you think we can handle (he has shares in youtube, imgur and giphy), your best housekeeping tips, anecdotes about times you've been suspicious of others, haikus about your feels, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt spoiler tags are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of r/KDRAMA (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but, there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to r/KDRAMA that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is time for nominations again, and because several people are in a drama slump thanks to certain idols/actors who have believed they have the right to do whatever with other human beings, the rule this time is:&lt;/p&gt;

**Plot**

Kim Soo-Hyun ([Chang Ki-Yong](http://asianwiki.com/Chang_Ki-Yong)) is an elite assassin. He kills his targets and disappears. His identity like race, age or name is unknown to others. Individuals, gangs and organizations from all over the world hire Kim Soo-Hyun. Deep within his mind, he wants to have affection from people. Now, Kim Soo-Hyun has to kill to find his family.

[Here comes the spoiler] 


Then those two final episodes happened...


They spent the whole drama trying to solve the case, putting their lives on hold until it was closed, but on the day the judge is going to make the most important pronouncement, the one that will decide the future of the serial killer, the couple is on a date, completely alone, in a park. 


A total of 0 people sent them texts to say the judge digged the serial killer pit and he was probably angry somewhere right now, plotting revenge, so stay inside your house, please. The whole tragedy happens. The police gets there too late, etc. 


So we get to the couch scene, Cha Min disappearing. I said to myself I've seen It somewhere Else. And It was, to my senses, so Goblin like. 


He fades away. She keeps living and waiting for him. We found out later he was walking through the earth alone and in pain until he finds that old guy again, the one who could see him and had an abyss too. 



In this part either I blinked or they never explained how Cha Min got his material body back, who was that old man, if Se-yeon father finally accepted her, what was the abyss, who were those aliens, didn't show Cha Min's mother reaction when he got back home, gave a lonely ending to Hee Jin, and that final ""I am going to the bathroom, hey I am pregnant"" scene made me cringe. 


The drama was on its way to get an A, but the ending felt rushed and thoughtless. I think It could use another two episodes to close things more smoothly.

&lt;p&gt;So we get to the couch scene, Cha Min disappearing. I said to myself I&amp;#39;ve seen It somewhere Else. And It was, to my senses, so Goblin like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He fades away. She keeps living and waiting for him. We found out later he was walking through the earth alone and in pain until he finds that old guy again, the one who could see him and had an abyss too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this part either I blinked or they never explained how Cha Min got his material body back, who was that old man, if Se-yeon father finally accepted her, what was the abyss, who were those aliens, didn&amp;#39;t show Cha Min&amp;#39;s mother reaction when he got back home, gave a lonely ending to Hee Jin, and that final &amp;quot;I am going to the bathroom, hey I am pregnant&amp;quot; scene made me cringe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama was on its way to get an A, but the ending felt rushed and thoughtless. I think It could use another two episodes to close things more smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts or even explanations my old self totally missed?&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed, you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post calculating the probability of our protagonists being the father based on their previous lifestyles, episodic notes, your fruit peeling tips, couple yoga benefits, near-truck experiences or links to your favourite Shin Sung Rok fanpage, the choice is yours.

If you have previously completed the drama or got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) (Reddit-wide spoiler tags are also available) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third to last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short-listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second to last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama that can be nominated, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch it, but there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/301-three-dads-one-mom""&gt;Three Dads One Mom.&lt;/a&gt; After covering episodes 1-3 today, we&amp;#39;ll discuss episodes 4-6 on Thursday.

Freegal Music is a service for libraries that allows card holders from the subscribing library to stream/download a certain amount of music every week. For me I can stream ~2 hours free and download 5 songs a week; I’m not sure if that’s standard or just my library’s agreement. Sure it can take a month or two  to get a whole album, but if I couldn’t budget in the purchase in that’s better than nothing!

A couple weeks ago on a whim I searched for some Ailee, not expecting to find anything, but low and behold, while I didn’t find the song I was looking for (not surprising) I did find the OST she did for Memories of the Alhambra. I went down that rabbit hole and found several full OST albums I’d considered buying but never got around to- This Life is My First, Hundred Million Stars from the Sky, and Encounter. I also found some partials - the individual OST release albums for Her Private Life (but not the full album version with all the bg music) and Rachael Yamagata’s songs from Something in the Rain.

Before writing this post I just did an album search for “Original Television Soundtrack,” and scanned for familiar names. Doing this I found Abyss, Mr. Sunshine, Let’s Eat 3, and He is Psychometric. There’s almost definitely more; I didn’t go too far down the list.

Freegal mainly partners with Sony, so probably any OST released under any of their sub labels will end up there. A lot (but not all) of the dramas partially funded by Netflix seem to be there.

Check your library website’s eResources to see if they subscribe to Freegal. Larger, well funded libraries are more likely to subscribe as it’s not cheap for them, but it never hurts to check (or ask)! Even if you’re not into OSTs they have a lot of good stuff there. Might as well get some good music from your taxes. ;)

Can you please help me understand the ending of the series?

*spoilers ahead*
How did SHE GET PREGNANT, they only met for like a day... and its been 3 years since he was gone. So how did she get pregnant real quick. Also, how were they married. Min was gone for 3 years and also of those years Se-yeon was just by herself. 

So how did they get married? And how did she get pregnant the day they just met after 3 years.

Also, WRITERS YOU ARE SO LAZY. THEY COULD HAVE DONE A BETTER ENDING BUT THIS WAS UTTERLY DISGUSTINGLY DISAPPOINTING. 

IN THE BEGINNING THEY WERE SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. And now i have even more questions. You are supposed to help me understand the series


Oh 
My 
Gawd

I am so sad.

I still love the series though nonetheless. The ending of this series reminds me of Memories of Alhambra and Meteor Garden ( Cdrama not Kdrama) These three dramas have the weirdest yet most confusing and out of the place ending that only writers or the producers of shows understand.

STILL I recommend this series AND MAKE SURE TO WATCH THIS IF U HAVE TIME TO KILL. i still love PBY and AHS. I really hope this will boost AHS career but since Abyss is getting negative reception. I think it wont help AHS get more recognition. 

Obviously, i still love the series even though the ending confused me.

Please, explain your thoughts and I would love to hear it and lets  help each other try to understand the ending of this series.

Ps. the cute scenes between PBY and AHS. Ah ❤️ it so cute oh my. Their onscreen chemistry made up for everything else. 

Really wish they do better, maybe a season 2 ? But with different writers and same cast. And explain EVERYTHING THAT SEASON 1 DIDNT ANSWER!!!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dear kdrama lovers...&lt;/p&gt;

We don&amp;#39;t expect our subtitle translations to change everyone&amp;#39;s name to their first name when it&amp;#39;s said as Mr /Ms last name.&lt;/p&gt;

Even though SITR was what it was, it really made me curious about Korea's culture so I decided to give Misaeng a chance. And now after 1,076 episodes, I'm feeling like I need a break.

The last movie I watched was in December of last year, and I haven't watched the new season of most shows I thought I was addicted to. This is by far my most visited subreddit and kdramas really consume most of my ""free time"". I'm definitely more picky about what to watch, after discovering about the tropes and the fate that a few dramas have that you can notice as soon as you start watching it.

If anything, I think that what made really like kdramas was the humor. I really liked the romance at first because it was more innocent than what we have here in the west, but if I had to pick a moment out of all these dramas I've watched in the past year, it would probably be the 3 second scene where Han Yeo Jin shows a sketch of Hwang Shi Mok to her colleague in the first episode. She looked serious in the posters so seeing her being funny in a situation liked that is something I can't forget.

If you're watching your very first dramas, enjoy it. It will be a fun ride.  I will finish One Spring Night as take a break for a while. I want to miss it.

I know this sub had talked about this show a lot but I have a lot I want to say about it.

For all it's flaws, and there were plenty, SWDBS was truly magical. I had never binged a show before to that degree, watching 3 to 4 episodes a day and conoletely abandoning my duties and responsibilities in real life 😅 but this show was crack and just compulsive viewing.

The chemistry between Hyung-sik and Bo-you was sizzling and oh so real and I loved the prickly and cute banter throughout. This show never took itself too seriously which worked well in its favour.

Park Bo-young was the perfect casting choice for DBS. You wouldn't find a cuter and more petite actress to play DBS and she was perfect. DBS goes down as one of my favourite kdrama characters, just so utterly likeable.

Hyung-sik was also stellar. His ad-libs such as ""Do Intern!"" were fantastic and really added to the comedy. Also his soulful gazes to DBS was on point.

The writing, while not terrible imho, was still the show's weakness as too much time was spent on Boss Taek, his underlings and the fake monk. It almost felt like a medical show at times with the amount of tine spent in the hospital lol. Also Kim Won-hae, while I usually like him, didn't find his character as the gay guy funny.

The serial kidnapper and creepy dude was well acted and the plot was thrilling but it was such a tonal shift from the cute and lighter stuff that it sometimes felt like I was watching a different show. And the kidnapper could have been fleshed out as a character much better.

Also Min-hyuk's family was conveniently forgotten in the second half of the show. I get that you guys aren't on good terms, but to not invite them to your wedding... ?

Despite thise flaws, show won me over and stole my heart. And that's what this show also had, it had heart. The biggest question this show asked us was if DBS would be able to live a normal life as she pleased without having to be a superhero (we still the same question posed to other superhero kdramas City Hunter and Healer). That's why I love the last scene so, so much with her looking over the city she swears to protect and then epically jumping down declaring she is DBS. I wish City Hunter had a similar scene, like of him vowing to protect the city after Young-ju's death rather tham him just driving off in his car.

One last parallel I will make with this show is with What's Wrong with Secretary Kim. Kim Mi-so and DBS both work for their boss as secretaries (DBS as a secretary to cover her identity earlier in the show) but both have ambitions to leave this position (Kim Mi-so wants to quit her job and DBS wants to join the strategy department). In the end they both end up not really fufilling those ambitions, Kim Mi-so still works for Young-joo and DBS was too preoccupied with saving the world. Would you say this is lack of character growth, or have they realised they didn't need what they were striving for?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;*also contains spoilers for City Hunter and What&amp;#39;s Wrong with Secretary Kim&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings)**. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. 

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

**Wow, 700 responses! Thank you all for participating. Let's try to break 1000 next year?**

   * The census will open back up soon for stragglers or those just joining us.

##Notes:

* So what sort of skews the employment results is that some people selected 'unemployed' and an occupation. Unemployed means that there is no current occupation.

* I think the World Region/Where Do You Live sections are right where they need to be. Thanks for the suggestion to get specific! Really cool to see where everyone is.

* The Race section is what needs tinkering. I have been looking for a more open categorization that keeps things broad but still allows for local identification based on that area's history: White (any origin), Black/African/Caribbean, Asian (includes the Indian subcontinent), Pacific Islander, Arab (any origin), Native/Indigenous, Hispanic/Latino, Mixed Race/Mixed Ethnicity, Other Racial/Ethnic Group(s).

* We're still a bunch of Single Pringles, aren't we? 

* Look at some of y'all with graduate degrees and professional degrees (including the ones who are working on them right now). Go on with your educated selves! Congratulations to everybody for making it through whatever school!

* Weekends are the most popular browsing days. Most of y'all are checking in regularly. 20% are irregular/once a month.

* I'm about to refresh the website choices as well as the how were you introduced to dramas choices so there aren't too many write-ins. Gotta keep up with the times/trends and keep things tidy!

* I love seeing the native languages responses! What a variety this time around.

* Korea travel questions went well. Thanks for the suggestion(s). Keeping these two.

We've been coming up out of the dip and we're over Feb/Mar numbers. The Song-Song Divorce caused a [spike in traffic](https://imgur.com/a/ZSOw5ck) that affected our averages somewhat, but we would already be higher than last month if the numbers held study. We *have* seen daily subscriptions pick up into the 100s (the 11th and on). I don't know what's driving that, but I don't expect it to dip down next month.

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been coming up out of the dip and we&amp;#39;re over Feb/Mar numbers. The Song-Song Divorce caused a &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/ZSOw5ck""&gt;spike in traffic&lt;/a&gt; that affected our averages somewhat, but we would already be higher than last month if the numbers held study. We &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen daily subscriptions pick up into the 100s (the 11th and on). I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s driving that, but I don&amp;#39;t expect it to dip down next month.&lt;/p&gt;

I [resign from my position](https://i.imgur.com/vjyhkVJ.jpg) as Weekly Binge host [effective immediately](https://i.imgur.com/rPsoa9R.jpg). I’ve [packed up my desk](https://i.imgur.com/WLsXOJs.jpg), no need to [help with my bags](https://i.imgur.com/6bdyRh9.png) on the way out. Watch out, [I'm taking the stairs](https://i.imgur.com/86gTzSs.png), there’s no way am I riding in [that hellevator](https://i.imgur.com/dfWXtLE.jpg). But don’t worry, I’ve accepted the fact that [I too am replaceable](https://i.imgur.com/dLPP4Yq.png). I’m leaving you all in u/AlohaAlex’s [very capable hands](https://giphy.com/gifs/jq0QFKN6bcstkmGE4G/tile) and I don’t think he’s the type to let the [power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGRv8ZBLuW0) go to his head although [I’m biased af](https://i.imgur.com/COR9lad.png). I might be [a little bored](https://i.imgur.com/Mj8JH5e.png) so if you see me on the streets [say hi](https://i.imgur.com/liKzBN9.png) or [pretend you don’t know me](https://i.imgur.com/ZJSBHdE.png), [I’ll leave it up to you](https://i.imgur.com/cVb2wtj.png). I’ll be [willing to come back in the future](https://i.imgur.com/HPxnLGh.png), if a big enough offer is on the table and [greet you all with open arms](https://i.imgur.com/dMzFC3f.png).

The second to last part of the review series is here! For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.

As usual, let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**April**

&amp;#x200B;

**My Fellow Citizens - KBS2**

Political satirical comedy drama about a conman who suddenly is forced to run for a spot at the National Assembly.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) There is a lot of smart humor in this show. In between the usual humor you would find in kdramas such as slapstick and cheap gags, you find nuggets of biting yet really funny social satire regarding modern politics. It treads the line between wacky and intelligent perfectly. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's not afraid to mock and criticize potentially controversial topics.

The show sometimes even treads the line of a black comedy but ends up balancing having a loan shark villain in a comedy series by making her and her accomplices quite bad at being villains, making even their murderous attempts quite humorous. Said loan shark, Park Hoo Ja played by Kim Min Jung, has a lot of great moments as she is clearly evil but also has some growing pains filling her dad's shoes. I find it hilarious how she has super convoluted plans to achieve her goals, how she sucks at both golf and pool, and how she always breathes a sigh of relief whenever the one whom she extorts leaves and she doesn't have to put up a facade of being a calm villain. All in all, it is a brilliant character and performance.

(2) The dialogue is razor sharp where many conversations between characters feel like an all out war. Many of the characters are quite verbally aggressive toward one another, constantly provoking and trying to one up each other. Interestingly enough, the characters show their verbal aggression in different ways. Some characters like the protagonist Yang Jung Gook played by Choi Siwon are loud and raise hell while some other characters are coy, sly or passive aggressive. I think this style of dialogue fits well with the drama considering it’s about politics and much of the debate in politics is a figurative war with words. 

(3) The show asks a lot of interesting questions to the viewer and is quite thought provoking. For instance, it asks the question whether it’s the corrupt who seek power, or if power is what corrupts. Congressman Kim Joo Myung played by Kim Eui Sang, who was once a bright eyed idealist didn’t enter politics as someone corrupt, rather politics turned him corrupt. The same goes for Han Sang Jin played by Tae In Ho. However, Yang Jung Kook was forced into politics already being a corrupt soul and it made him aspire to do something other than scam people. Instead of relying on his con man ways, which works just fine if you want to become a politician who just feeds the people lies, he wants to use politics as a tool to help people. In a way, politics turned him into an idealist just like Joo Myung and Sang Jin once were. This shows the duality of politics and power. Maybe it is not power that absolutely corrupts, but rather how you use that power.  

There are also connections between the drama and the theory of public choice. It shows many of the aspects that self interested agents in the political field deal with. For instance, it shows that even though a politician knows what is for example the best economic choice, they will stray away from that as gaining voting followers is more important to them. They serve their own interests through their choices even though they are aware of what is the better choice, instead they go with the more popular choice. It also shows how different lobby groups work in order to get politicians to make policy decisions that will benefit their interest group. 

(4) They use some really cool shots throughout the show. While it is not all original ideas, it is still cool to see them using other people’s work as inspiration and integrating it to their own series. One example of this where I screamed “That’s the Tarantino angle!”, is when they film a bunch of characters looking into a safe and it is made to look like it’s being filmed from within the safe with all the characters looking into the camera. 

There are some other great moments where characters intentionally break the rule of “don’t look into the camera” for comedic effect and break the fourth wall while delivering messages to the watcher, while in the context of the scene also talking to another character opposite them. Big props to director Kim Jung Hyun for his creativity with the camera shots.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The lack of realism is sometimes used just for cheap thrills. I’m fine with unrealistic plot points when it is set up as a deliberate joke or for wacky comedy purposes but when it is supposed to be taken seriously it just makes me question the writing. For instance, the election results scene bothers me quite a bit in this regard. &gt;!In a real election, once 20% of votes are counted you get a pretty accurate portrayal of what the final result will look like and comebacks where someone only has half the votes of the winning candidate at this point are highly unlikely. However, my main problem with this is not it’s statistical unlikeliness. My main problem is that it feels like the reproduction of the trope from sports movies where the underdog makes an extremely unlikely comeback. Overall, this plot point was just not very well thought out or executed as it uses unrealistic writing to poor effect.!&lt;

(2) The series requires some major suspension of disbelief to not question the premise of it. Like, how does Lee Yoo Young’s character Mi Young not catch on to her husband Jung Gook being a con artist? She is a detective and people tell her and more or less give away the fact that he is a con man. She ought to be more doubtful and suspicious of him. The counter argument towards this would be that she is in denial and refuses to see the truth even when it is right in front of her. If that would be the case, then I would have liked some scenes showing her reaching that state of denial, how she figures out the truth but ultimately convinces herself that her husband can’t possibly be a con man.

(3) Some characters are introduced early on in the series and then it takes forever before they become important to the plot or are seen on screen again at all. The prime example of this is the oldest sister of Hoo Ja, who was introduced in episode 10 and then not mentioned again until episode 28. It feels really disjointed and makes it obvious that the introduction scene exists purely for exposition purposes.

(4) The ending was quite flat as there were simply too many different plot lines and characters to be able to give them all a fleshed out ending to their character arcs and stories. This is the backside of having quite a large plot with tons of characters that doesn’t run out of steam. You need to cover everything in this rather large plot in only 18 hours, which is a hard task to face. Unfortunately, this resulted in the ending feeling rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 9,0 / 10* \- The series has some major flaws but the uniqueness of it and all it strengths still make for an excellent drama. It probably won’t make the history books as one of the most influential or popular dramas of the year, but it will remain a personal favorite of mine for a long time.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Beautiful World - JTBC**

Melodrama about a school violence case that ends up with one middle school boy in a coma while his parents seek the truth of what really happened.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) This drama is probably the most emotional and gripping one of the year so far. It paints a very nuanced picture of bullying by not just portraying the bullies as pure evil but rather showing that they are products of their surrounding (mainly their parents), which I commend it for. There are a lot of heart wrenching scenes in this drama that are likely to drain you emotionally. As a future teacher, this hit especially close to home as the problems of bullying and school violence are unfortunately going to be occurrences that I will have to deal with in my future career. The one scene that really stands out in my mind is the beginning of episode 3 when it becomes clear to the viewer how vile the situation is and contrasts it with the parents happy memories of their now comatosed child. What baffles me is that this isn’t even the hardest or tragic scene to sit through. That would be the reveal of what actually happened to &gt;!the little depressed girl Da Hae!&lt;, as those scenes made me feel things that I cannot even put into words. The closest I’ll get to a description is “severely sick to my stomach”.

(2) The cinematography is really visually interesting. They sometimes go a bit overboard with it and can be a bit distracting, but I’d rather see a show that actually tries to have artistic merit than one that has really plain visual appeal. They try really hard and I appreciate the effort. The shots through the glass walls and windows in Joon Seok’s house work as great visual cues, showing when characters are divided or united. In many scenes we see Joon Seok’s father occupying the larger space of the window whereas the rest of the family are confined to smaller spaces, clearly showing that he is the one wielding the power. Probably my favorite shot of the entire series is Joon Seok’s father looking at his son through a windowpane that is shaped like a clock, indicating “like father, like son”, that although time passes, the same values, morals and evil has been transferred from grandfather, to father, to son.   

(3) The drama is a prime subject for sociological analysis, which is a great indication that the writers did a good job of writing believable characters with very human traits and responses. The authorities in this drama reminds me of the future of the dystopian vision that Max Weber held of an absolute bureaucracy, where the individuals holding authority are just a cog in the machinery and feel little to no personable responsibility for the lives of others. They are just following protocol to make sure the machinery keeps running smoothly. Other interesting parallels can be drawn to Goffman’s theories about stigma and coping with stigma as well as Durkheim’s ideas of a hierarchy of consensus.

(4) The drama incorporates references to J.D. Salinger's classic ”Catcher in the Rye” and manages to put an interesting spin on the original novel with its interpretation of it. By no means are the plots similar to one another but they carry many of the same messages when interpreting the novel within the context of the drama.

(5) The dialogue is full of subtext and much of what the characters actually say isn’t actually what they think and feel, as the traumatic events that have unfolded are so hard to talk out loud about. They work the whole trope of “lack of communication between characters” in a smart way as their problems could be solved by honesty but the stigma is way too strong to actually tell the truth.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) Although the drama is well written, the story moves at a snail’s pace. The drama contains well thought out plot points but they are spaced too far from each other which results in the plot ending up being quite thin. It also takes so long to get any sort of pay off from all the suffering as there are so many obstacles in the way for the plot to get moving along and it is left stomping in the same place for very long, though when the payoff finally comes it feels worth it. The plot is mostly predictable despite how complex it is, which makes the slow pacing even more tedious as you sit and wait patiently only for your predictions to all come true.

(2) The melodrama is so heavy that you need to be in a very certain mood to enjoy the show. At the same time, trying to binge watch this show is not a great idea unless you have slightly masochistic tendencies. It’s not the kind of drama that provides some healthy crying either, rather it leaves you with a hole in your chest and an unsettling feeling in your stomach. Don’t expect to go into this drama and keep a happy mood for the rest of the day, as watching this drama includes a lot of suffering. This is both a strength but also a weakness of the drama as it is not very multi-purpose and you need to pick your viewing sessions of this show well.

(3) Even though I complimented the drama for being visually interesting, I don’t think the cinematography is that good at reinforcing the portrayal of themes and emotions throughout the drama. For instance, I’m not a big fan of how they use voyeuristic camera angles in their shots even when there is no one listening in on the conversation or to indicate that the setting is enclosed, voyeuristic and lacking in privacy. Examples of directors using such shots excellently to establish and reinforce the setting is Wong Kar Wai’s ”In The Mood For Love” (2000) and Alfred Hitchcock’s ”Rear Window” (1954). The setting in this drama is rather the opposite, yes people gossip a lot about the lives of others but it’s not because they have insight into their lives but instead because they lack insight. The people in this drama are isolated from one another, as the worlds of different families are separated and the world of the adolescents is separated from the world of the adults.

The show also uses so many over the shoulder shots. I get it since the show is so dialogue-heavy, but there are other angles and perspectives you can use to spice things up. Whenever they do a close up or a wide shot during the dialogue, it feels really refreshing. Therefore, I wish they would mix things up a little more when it comes to the camera angles during character dialogue.

(4) Even though the acting is good for the most part, it is quite inconsistent as some actors have some shaky performances.  As it is a story of an event taking place at a middle school, there are a lot of child actors who are somewhat hit or miss. Some of the adult actors are also prone to over-acting. Overacting is not always bad as it can be used for comedic effect or mockery, for instance, see Kim Byung Chul’s character in “SKY Castle” (2018) where he is overacting to make a mockery out of the typical patriarchal father. They try to make a similar mockery of stereotypical characters in this drama, like the vice principal who only thinks about his promotion played by Jang Jae Sung and the rabid helicopter mom played by Kang Mal Geum, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. Choo Ja Hyun as Seon Ho’s mom tends to overact quite a bit as well, as there are more nuanced ways of expressing sadness than just wailing in every other scene.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- It is a gripping and emotional story but the pacing is rather slow and some of the acting and cinematography feels misplaced. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Special Labor Inspector Jo - MBC** 

Social satire, comedy, crime drama about a labor inspector who is out to punish business owners who treat their workers poorly.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The premise and the subject matter is really good and the show manages to be really heartfelt at points. It showcases the grim reality the working and middle class of Korea have to deal with in a believable manner. The depiction of how the chain of blame works is excellent. The chairman lashes out at the CEO who lashes out at his subordinates. It gives you some perspective on the psychology of bosses. The depictions of how workers cope with difficult working conditions is also really nice, whether it be destructive ways of coping like alcoholism or strengthening ways of coping like through love and family. 

(2) Ryu Deok Hwan plays the lawyer Woo Do Ha, who is like the eye of the storm, perfectly. The character has such gravitos because he doesn’t need to get aggressive or make any grand displays to showcase his power. He rarely loses his cool and stays ice cold no matter how crazy a situation gets. These types of antagonists are the scariest of all as they can be all civilized and polite while planning to end you. Incredible performance of a really intriguing character. Oh, and did I mention that the actor is also a screenwriter, director and has 25 years of acting experience, at the mere age of 31? Kid’s got talent.

(3) The payoff for whenever any bad guys get put in their place is definitely worth all the build up and feels very satisfying. If you are the type of person to enjoy these “sticking it to the man” stories then this drama is something for you.

(4) The drama gets a lot better in the second half where the stakes are higher and the cases become increasingly personal and pressing for the main cast. No longer are complicated relationships in the past the point of conflict but rather current issues that affect the lives of near and dear characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) There are too many flashbacks of the same scenes and events. They rarely add any new information and just indicate that the writer thinks their audience is too stupid to follow along the story. Too many unnecessary fake outs and reveals of plot information that was hidden away from the viewer, when said reveal is not even that impactful to the story. At other times, they have already shown us the result of an event and then show the flashback which takes all the suspense out of the flashback. This all boils down to decisions in editing that weren’t always the best. Speaking of the editing, the editing of the initial episodes of the drama makes the setup of it really hard to follow as they don’t introduce characters before putting them in important scenes.

(2) There is not very good attention to detail throughout the drama. There are a surprising amount of continuity errors. It’s up to the set designer and editing to make sure that these don’t occur. I imagine that working on the sets and in the editing room of kdramas is very stressful so these kinds of errors are understandable. However, they still impact the overall quality of the drama. One example of this is when an office worker drops a stack of papers on the floor in one shot and in the next, said papers are several meters away. Also, I understand using CGI for small details such as a bug in a dirty kitchen is overkill, but you have to use better props than a plastic toy bought at a toy store. The only way you get away with having such cheap props is if you brush it off as a joke, but that’s about it.

(3) The drama includes a pretty poor depiction of a suicide attempt. The scene is done in such a casual manner, almost making light of it with how non-dramatic it is.  I know there is a law against graphic depictions of the moment of suicide in Korean broadcasting regulations, but I feel like depictions of suicide need to be more dramatic than what they did in this drama. Of course, romanticizing suicide is not something a filmmaker should do either, but it certainly requires a serious execution. 

(4) One of the golden rules of storytelling is ”show don’t tell”, which I feel this show could have done better. The show rarely lets events speak for themselves and instead have the characters monologue afterwards about why said event is unethical. “Show don’t tell” is especially important in a satire based show where telling someone the message and the point over and over again can end up feeling preachy, instead of enlightening. 

(5) Speaking of which, satire and comedy are almost entirely separated in this drama. Sure there are some good ironic jokes that are not in your face, like the corrupt “Clean Governor”, possibly being a comment on that people and governments who feel the need to call themselves clean and democratic usually are the most corrupt. Overall though, the satire is very serious throughout and the comedy is used for comic relief purposes in order to keep the drama from getting too dark and brooding. In my opinion, this style of satire is worse than a tongue-in-cheek satire as the writers can get away with less social criticism while being serious and can often come across as pushing an agenda or a message way too hard on its viewers. As the message is often constituted by platitudes as well, the satire becomes very watered down and safe, which is the opposite purpose of satire. You want it to be provoking, so that it can spawn a debate regarding the issues at hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 6,5 / 10* \- The premise and the subject matter are definitely really good and the drama builds to become a lot better towards the back half but the editing mistakes and choices along with the overtness of the comedy-less satire and the message it is trying to put forth makes the drama drop off in quality, at least to me.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**Her Private Life - TvN**

Romcom, slice of life drama about a painter who meets a curator by profession, fangirl by lifestyle, whereupon they fall in love at work.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The color grading in the drama is really visually pleasing, making each color pop. As there is so much focus on color and how it is assigned and associated with different characters, it fits perfectly here. How this is done is that you isolate a certain color and then you grade them individually in a digital program to create different effects. In combination with the set design often having quite neutral backgrounds it allows for certain colors to really stand out. 

(2) The main leads have so many great scenes together thanks to good editing choices, acting and writing. The silence in intimate scenes is really effectful. It creates so much more tension than just blasting “romantic/emotional” music. It really gives the chemistry between the two leads room to shine and boy does it shine. Kim Jae Wook as Ryan Gold and Park Min Young as Sung Deok Mi both do a fantastic job at portraying a couple that is truly in love. Park Min Young is experienced in being the leading lady in romcoms and always puts up a good performance, whereas Kim Jae Wook really surprised with this being his first real romcom and yet he knocked it out of the park. The writing of the main characters really help as well since the couple is written to be reliant on each other but still keep their own autonomy. I really enjoy that they feel like equals in their relationship. Yes, Ryan is technically Deok Mi’s boss but it rarely feels like he uses his position to force Deok Mi things she wouldn’t otherwise do. They are both respectful towards each other and impossibly cute together. 

(3) “Her Private Life” reminds me a lot of shoujo manga/anime or a Jane Austen novel in its storytelling. A lot of the story is just looking into the mind of the main female protagonist and getting to know her emotions, her longing and her dreams. Much of the interesting parts of this character driven drama takes place in their minds and it is visualized very well through the scenes of the fantasy scenarios of different characters and what happens on the fan page Deok Mi runs.

There are some slice of life aspects to the show which means it has a quiet and slow type of story focusing on rather ordinary people. It's not meant to be an epic love story or heartbreaking melodrama, and it doesn't throw in a crime subplot just for the heck of it. Some might view this type of story as boring, I see it as endearing and charming.

(4) Some of the product placement is really well done. The Canon cameras are among the most natural product placement I’ve seen in kdrama. Great choice of sponsor and they make the products essentially an accessory that fits in the story with both the fangirling aspect of the show as well as the photography/art side of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) Although the Canon product placement is done well, a lot of product placement in this drama is very in your face without any integration into the story or subtlety. I understand that unless the drama is a historical one, there will be product placement. However, there are creative and good ways to incorporate it into the drama, like they did with the Canon cameras. At times, the sponsorships of the drama are really aggravating and in your face which impacts the enjoyability of the drama.

(2) Some of the characters outside of the main couple are shallowly written. The “brother” character Eun Gi has some really shallow writing and very few character traits. He likes judo and Deok Mi, that’s it. The actor Ahn Bohyun who plays Eun Gi is also a noticeably less experienced actor with this being one of his first main roles. This really shows in the scenes with the family when being on screen at the same time as Deok Mi’s parents played by Kim Mi Kyung and Maeng Sang Hoon, both of which are fantastic. There are other very shallowly written characters in the drama as well such as Da In. However, since she at least knows what she is doing to keep Ryan and Deok Mi from each other is wrong, as well as her being a supporting character, unlike Eun Gi, I am more forgiving about her character. 

(3) The camera work frustrates me at times. In some of the intimate scenes between Deok Mi and Ryan they keep spinning the camera around the couple, breaking the 180 degree rule multiple times and making the viewer disoriented and almost dizzy. I get that they are trying to be dramatic about their kissing but I would liked it better if they toned it down just a bit in favor of better camera work. 

(4) The last quarter of the drama really drops off in terms of writing. Who asked for a &gt;!prolonged childhood connection and backstory!&lt; arc? Not me, that’s for sure. Since the drama is adapted from the novel “Noona fan dot com” (2007) and I haven’t read the novel, I’m not sure if this unnecessary part of the story is a byproduct of making a faithful adaptation or not. Nevertheless, there are a lot of other more interesting things they could have explored such as &gt;!Ryan’s inability to paint and following his rehabilitation helped by Deok Mi, instead of just having him miraculously be able to paint again.!&lt; Even if they were dead set on having &gt;!the childhood backstory !&lt;arc play out, they could have executed it way better as it currently requires a lot of suspension of disbelief and doesn’t add anything important to the characterization of the characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- This drama is a really great romcom drama that unfortunately falls off a fair bit towards the last quarter of the show. On the whole, it is still a very enjoyable drama.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**My First First Love (Season 1) - Netflix**

A coming of age, slice of life, romance drama about a group of college aged friends who end up living together and experience love, friendship and life as young adults.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The first episode does a really excellent job of establishing the characters and the setting and keeping a good balance between exposition and hooking the viewer in. To start with, the cinematography really keeps up with the urgency of the story. The scenes flow into each other in a very natural way, which I think is a byproduct of not having commercial breaks. We are shown the different characters’ backgrounds and their variation in socioeconomic status and yet they all end up in the same place as they all have pretty good motivations for leaving home.

(2) For the most part, I really like the cinematography. I enjoy how some shots linger after the characters go off-screen and then fades into a flashback from the same place is exquisite film making. Sure it’s been done before by why not borrow inspiration if it works?

I also like the amount of extreme close ups they use to really emphasis the actions of characters in certain shots. It can be such ordinary things as opening a bag or twisting the accelerator on the scooter or something as moving as wiping someone’s tears away. It makes the drama feel more alive as there is more motion in the frame and allows for some sequences with fast cuts to add to the motion.  

The drama also makes good use of the basics of different angled shots. When the characters are down on their luck it shows us them from above looking down on them making us see them as vulnerable. When they are standing up for someone it shows us them from below looking up on the which makes them look powerful. It is also used in conversations when the angle switches depending on the mood of the current speaker when one character is sad and the other is happy, which is pretty clever.

(3) The continuity control is pretty tight in this drama, well done to the script supervisor for making sure it is pretty free from any continuity errors. The level of drinks in non-opaque glasses tend to stay the same, a character who gets hit actually has marks from it later on and there are no major flubs with any props as far as I noticed.

(4) The story is set up to turn out in two different ways in season 2, both of which would be quite interesting. As it is a remake of the 2015 drama ”Because this is the first time”, the writer could choose to keep the original ending from that drama which is a pretty unique ending in the context of kdramas. However, they could also decide to change the ending to be different than the original drama which I would see as surprising but still plausible. No matter which route they decided to go down, I will be happy either way.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) As it is a season 1, it ends on a cliffhanger and we will have to wait for the resolve until the release of season 2 which has its official release date set to July 26. They’ve had the entire drama filmed already and the reason for splitting it into two parts is probably to give time for post production to do their magic as well as build up hype for the ending of the series.

(2) I wish they would chill with the lens flare and the super bright color grading. It’s like every time there is sun outside they feel the need to use lens flares and if the sun is coming in through a window, they use really bright filters in post production to drown the characters in light. This is clearly a stylistic choice and while I respect their choice, I don’t agree with it personally. It’s just not an aesthetic that I tend to be drawn towards as it creates less depth within a picture as the contours don’t show as well. 

(3) The roles that the main cast play aren’t the most challenging. Ji Soo is the one who shines the brightest but it feels like the role of Tae Oh is not letting him live up to his potential. The one role that required the most range was Jung Chaeyeon’s role as Song-i but I don’t feel like she delivered as well as I wished. For instance, Song-i’s most emotional and hard hitting scene is the bridge scene in episode 2. It’s good, but mainly thanks to the lines being really well written and the context of the scene rather than Chaeyeon’s performance being spectacular.

(4) The character Se Hyon is just such a drag and we have to wait until next season until we find out why she is so unlikable to everyone around her. It’s a bit of a shame for the actress who plays her, Hong Ji Yoon, as she tends to be typecast to play vain and antagonistic characters. As it stands, her motivations are never made clear and she exists merely to be a pebble in Song-i’s shoe. I have a feeling her character might also have the purpose of teaching Tae Oh a valuable lesson about love. &gt;!In his desperate search for a girlfriend who is everything he dreamed of, he only finds pain and potentially even loses the girl he has always been truly in love with in order to seek a perfect love that doesn’t exist.!&lt; However, this remains to be seen in the second season and until it is revealed what her character arc is like, her character feels like a bit of a hollow shell.

(5) As the show has a heavy romance focus, the characters who are not part of any romance get a bit shafted for story development and screen time despite being main characters. The characters Choi Hoon and especially Oh Ga Rin suffer from this and for a drama with an ensemble cast to work really well, all the characters in the ensemble have to get the chance to shine.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,0 / 10* \- It’s a well shot drama with a quiet everyday story. It’s not fantastic and it does have its flaws but overall it does a good job of portraying young adult romance and friendships. I can imagine this drama being a good palate cleanser after watching something intense.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second to last part of the review series is here! For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, let&amp;#39;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Fellow Citizens - KBS2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political satirical comedy drama about a conman who suddenly is forced to run for a spot at the National Assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There is a lot of smart humor in this show. In between the usual humor you would find in kdramas such as slapstick and cheap gags, you find nuggets of biting yet really funny social satire regarding modern politics. It treads the line between wacky and intelligent perfectly. It doesn&amp;#39;t take itself too seriously and it&amp;#39;s not afraid to mock and criticize potentially controversial topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show sometimes even treads the line of a black comedy but ends up balancing having a loan shark villain in a comedy series by making her and her accomplices quite bad at being villains, making even their murderous attempts quite humorous. Said loan shark, Park Hoo Ja played by Kim Min Jung, has a lot of great moments as she is clearly evil but also has some growing pains filling her dad&amp;#39;s shoes. I find it hilarious how she has super convoluted plans to achieve her goals, how she sucks at both golf and pool, and how she always breathes a sigh of relief whenever the one whom she extorts leaves and she doesn&amp;#39;t have to put up a facade of being a calm villain. All in all, it is a brilliant character and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The dialogue is razor sharp where many conversations between characters feel like an all out war. Many of the characters are quite verbally aggressive toward one another, constantly provoking and trying to one up each other. Interestingly enough, the characters show their verbal aggression in different ways. Some characters like the protagonist Yang Jung Gook played by Choi Siwon are loud and raise hell while some other characters are coy, sly or passive aggressive. I think this style of dialogue fits well with the drama considering it’s about politics and much of the debate in politics is a figurative war with words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The show asks a lot of interesting questions to the viewer and is quite thought provoking. For instance, it asks the question whether it’s the corrupt who seek power, or if power is what corrupts. Congressman Kim Joo Myung played by Kim Eui Sang, who was once a bright eyed idealist didn’t enter politics as someone corrupt, rather politics turned him corrupt. The same goes for Han Sang Jin played by Tae In Ho. However, Yang Jung Kook was forced into politics already being a corrupt soul and it made him aspire to do something other than scam people. Instead of relying on his con man ways, which works just fine if you want to become a politician who just feeds the people lies, he wants to use politics as a tool to help people. In a way, politics turned him into an idealist just like Joo Myung and Sang Jin once were. This shows the duality of politics and power. Maybe it is not power that absolutely corrupts, but rather how you use that power.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also connections between the drama and the theory of public choice. It shows many of the aspects that self interested agents in the political field deal with. For instance, it shows that even though a politician knows what is for example the best economic choice, they will stray away from that as gaining voting followers is more important to them. They serve their own interests through their choices even though they are aware of what is the better choice, instead they go with the more popular choice. It also shows how different lobby groups work in order to get politicians to make policy decisions that will benefit their interest group. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) They use some really cool shots throughout the show. While it is not all original ideas, it is still cool to see them using other people’s work as inspiration and integrating it to their own series. One example of this where I screamed “That’s the Tarantino angle!”, is when they film a bunch of characters looking into a safe and it is made to look like it’s being filmed from within the safe with all the characters looking into the camera. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some other great moments where characters intentionally break the rule of “don’t look into the camera” for comedic effect and break the fourth wall while delivering messages to the watcher, while in the context of the scene also talking to another character opposite them. Big props to director Kim Jung Hyun for his creativity with the camera shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The lack of realism is sometimes used just for cheap thrills. I’m fine with unrealistic plot points when it is set up as a deliberate joke or for wacky comedy purposes but when it is supposed to be taken seriously it just makes me question the writing. For instance, the election results scene bothers me quite a bit in this regard. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In a real election, once 20% of votes are counted you get a pretty accurate portrayal of what the final result will look like and comebacks where someone only has half the votes of the winning candidate at this point are highly unlikely. However, my main problem with this is not it’s statistical unlikeliness. My main problem is that it feels like the reproduction of the trope from sports movies where the underdog makes an extremely unlikely comeback. Overall, this plot point was just not very well thought out or executed as it uses unrealistic writing to poor effect.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The series requires some major suspension of disbelief to not question the premise of it. Like, how does Lee Yoo Young’s character Mi Young not catch on to her husband Jung Gook being a con artist? She is a detective and people tell her and more or less give away the fact that he is a con man. She ought to be more doubtful and suspicious of him. The counter argument towards this would be that she is in denial and refuses to see the truth even when it is right in front of her. If that would be the case, then I would have liked some scenes showing her reaching that state of denial, how she figures out the truth but ultimately convinces herself that her husband can’t possibly be a con man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some characters are introduced early on in the series and then it takes forever before they become important to the plot or are seen on screen again at all. The prime example of this is the oldest sister of Hoo Ja, who was introduced in episode 10 and then not mentioned again until episode 28. It feels really disjointed and makes it obvious that the introduction scene exists purely for exposition purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The ending was quite flat as there were simply too many different plot lines and characters to be able to give them all a fleshed out ending to their character arcs and stories. This is the backside of having quite a large plot with tons of characters that doesn’t run out of steam. You need to cover everything in this rather large plot in only 18 hours, which is a hard task to face. Unfortunately, this resulted in the ending feeling rushed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 9,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The series has some major flaws but the uniqueness of it and all it strengths still make for an excellent drama. It probably won’t make the history books as one of the most influential or popular dramas of the year, but it will remain a personal favorite of mine for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful World - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melodrama about a school violence case that ends up with one middle school boy in a coma while his parents seek the truth of what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is probably the most emotional and gripping one of the year so far. It paints a very nuanced picture of bullying by not just portraying the bullies as pure evil but rather showing that they are products of their surrounding (mainly their parents), which I commend it for. There are a lot of heart wrenching scenes in this drama that are likely to drain you emotionally. As a future teacher, this hit especially close to home as the problems of bullying and school violence are unfortunately going to be occurrences that I will have to deal with in my future career. The one scene that really stands out in my mind is the beginning of episode 3 when it becomes clear to the viewer how vile the situation is and contrasts it with the parents happy memories of their now comatosed child. What baffles me is that this isn’t even the hardest or tragic scene to sit through. That would be the reveal of what actually happened to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the little depressed girl Da Hae&lt;/span&gt;, as those scenes made me feel things that I cannot even put into words. The closest I’ll get to a description is “severely sick to my stomach”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The cinematography is really visually interesting. They sometimes go a bit overboard with it and can be a bit distracting, but I’d rather see a show that actually tries to have artistic merit than one that has really plain visual appeal. They try really hard and I appreciate the effort. The shots through the glass walls and windows in Joon Seok’s house work as great visual cues, showing when characters are divided or united. In many scenes we see Joon Seok’s father occupying the larger space of the window whereas the rest of the family are confined to smaller spaces, clearly showing that he is the one wielding the power. Probably my favorite shot of the entire series is Joon Seok’s father looking at his son through a windowpane that is shaped like a clock, indicating “like father, like son”, that although time passes, the same values, morals and evil has been transferred from grandfather, to father, to son.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The drama is a prime subject for sociological analysis, which is a great indication that the writers did a good job of writing believable characters with very human traits and responses. The authorities in this drama reminds me of the future of the dystopian vision that Max Weber held of an absolute bureaucracy, where the individuals holding authority are just a cog in the machinery and feel little to no personable responsibility for the lives of others. They are just following protocol to make sure the machinery keeps running smoothly. Other interesting parallels can be drawn to Goffman’s theories about stigma and coping with stigma as well as Durkheim’s ideas of a hierarchy of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The drama incorporates references to J.D. Salinger&amp;#39;s classic ”Catcher in the Rye” and manages to put an interesting spin on the original novel with its interpretation of it. By no means are the plots similar to one another but they carry many of the same messages when interpreting the novel within the context of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The dialogue is full of subtext and much of what the characters actually say isn’t actually what they think and feel, as the traumatic events that have unfolded are so hard to talk out loud about. They work the whole trope of “lack of communication between characters” in a smart way as their problems could be solved by honesty but the stigma is way too strong to actually tell the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the drama is well written, the story moves at a snail’s pace. The drama contains well thought out plot points but they are spaced too far from each other which results in the plot ending up being quite thin. It also takes so long to get any sort of pay off from all the suffering as there are so many obstacles in the way for the plot to get moving along and it is left stomping in the same place for very long, though when the payoff finally comes it feels worth it. The plot is mostly predictable despite how complex it is, which makes the slow pacing even more tedious as you sit and wait patiently only for your predictions to all come true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The melodrama is so heavy that you need to be in a very certain mood to enjoy the show. At the same time, trying to binge watch this show is not a great idea unless you have slightly masochistic tendencies. It’s not the kind of drama that provides some healthy crying either, rather it leaves you with a hole in your chest and an unsettling feeling in your stomach. Don’t expect to go into this drama and keep a happy mood for the rest of the day, as watching this drama includes a lot of suffering. This is both a strength but also a weakness of the drama as it is not very multi-purpose and you need to pick your viewing sessions of this show well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Even though I complimented the drama for being visually interesting, I don’t think the cinematography is that good at reinforcing the portrayal of themes and emotions throughout the drama. For instance, I’m not a big fan of how they use voyeuristic camera angles in their shots even when there is no one listening in on the conversation or to indicate that the setting is enclosed, voyeuristic and lacking in privacy. Examples of directors using such shots excellently to establish and reinforce the setting is Wong Kar Wai’s ”In The Mood For Love” (2000) and Alfred Hitchcock’s ”Rear Window” (1954). The setting in this drama is rather the opposite, yes people gossip a lot about the lives of others but it’s not because they have insight into their lives but instead because they lack insight. The people in this drama are isolated from one another, as the worlds of different families are separated and the world of the adolescents is separated from the world of the adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show also uses so many over the shoulder shots. I get it since the show is so dialogue-heavy, but there are other angles and perspectives you can use to spice things up. Whenever they do a close up or a wide shot during the dialogue, it feels really refreshing. Therefore, I wish they would mix things up a little more when it comes to the camera angles during character dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Even though the acting is good for the most part, it is quite inconsistent as some actors have some shaky performances.  As it is a story of an event taking place at a middle school, there are a lot of child actors who are somewhat hit or miss. Some of the adult actors are also prone to over-acting. Overacting is not always bad as it can be used for comedic effect or mockery, for instance, see Kim Byung Chul’s character in “SKY Castle” (2018) where he is overacting to make a mockery out of the typical patriarchal father. They try to make a similar mockery of stereotypical characters in this drama, like the vice principal who only thinks about his promotion played by Jang Jae Sung and the rabid helicopter mom played by Kang Mal Geum, but it doesn’t work nearly as well. Choo Ja Hyun as Seon Ho’s mom tends to overact quite a bit as well, as there are more nuanced ways of expressing sadness than just wailing in every other scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is a gripping and emotional story but the pacing is rather slow and some of the acting and cinematography feels misplaced. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Labor Inspector Jo - MBC&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social satire, comedy, crime drama about a labor inspector who is out to punish business owners who treat their workers poorly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The premise and the subject matter is really good and the show manages to be really heartfelt at points. It showcases the grim reality the working and middle class of Korea have to deal with in a believable manner. The depiction of how the chain of blame works is excellent. The chairman lashes out at the CEO who lashes out at his subordinates. It gives you some perspective on the psychology of bosses. The depictions of how workers cope with difficult working conditions is also really nice, whether it be destructive ways of coping like alcoholism or strengthening ways of coping like through love and family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Ryu Deok Hwan plays the lawyer Woo Do Ha, who is like the eye of the storm, perfectly. The character has such gravitos because he doesn’t need to get aggressive or make any grand displays to showcase his power. He rarely loses his cool and stays ice cold no matter how crazy a situation gets. These types of antagonists are the scariest of all as they can be all civilized and polite while planning to end you. Incredible performance of a really intriguing character. Oh, and did I mention that the actor is also a screenwriter, director and has 25 years of acting experience, at the mere age of 31? Kid’s got talent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The payoff for whenever any bad guys get put in their place is definitely worth all the build up and feels very satisfying. If you are the type of person to enjoy these “sticking it to the man” stories then this drama is something for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The drama gets a lot better in the second half where the stakes are higher and the cases become increasingly personal and pressing for the main cast. No longer are complicated relationships in the past the point of conflict but rather current issues that affect the lives of near and dear characters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) There are too many flashbacks of the same scenes and events. They rarely add any new information and just indicate that the writer thinks their audience is too stupid to follow along the story. Too many unnecessary fake outs and reveals of plot information that was hidden away from the viewer, when said reveal is not even that impactful to the story. At other times, they have already shown us the result of an event and then show the flashback which takes all the suspense out of the flashback. This all boils down to decisions in editing that weren’t always the best. Speaking of the editing, the editing of the initial episodes of the drama makes the setup of it really hard to follow as they don’t introduce characters before putting them in important scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) There is not very good attention to detail throughout the drama. There are a surprising amount of continuity errors. It’s up to the set designer and editing to make sure that these don’t occur. I imagine that working on the sets and in the editing room of kdramas is very stressful so these kinds of errors are understandable. However, they still impact the overall quality of the drama. One example of this is when an office worker drops a stack of papers on the floor in one shot and in the next, said papers are several meters away. Also, I understand using CGI for small details such as a bug in a dirty kitchen is overkill, but you have to use better props than a plastic toy bought at a toy store. The only way you get away with having such cheap props is if you brush it off as a joke, but that’s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The drama includes a pretty poor depiction of a suicide attempt. The scene is done in such a casual manner, almost making light of it with how non-dramatic it is.  I know there is a law against graphic depictions of the moment of suicide in Korean broadcasting regulations, but I feel like depictions of suicide need to be more dramatic than what they did in this drama. Of course, romanticizing suicide is not something a filmmaker should do either, but it certainly requires a serious execution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) One of the golden rules of storytelling is ”show don’t tell”, which I feel this show could have done better. The show rarely lets events speak for themselves and instead have the characters monologue afterwards about why said event is unethical. “Show don’t tell” is especially important in a satire based show where telling someone the message and the point over and over again can end up feeling preachy, instead of enlightening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Speaking of which, satire and comedy are almost entirely separated in this drama. Sure there are some good ironic jokes that are not in your face, like the corrupt “Clean Governor”, possibly being a comment on that people and governments who feel the need to call themselves clean and democratic usually are the most corrupt. Overall though, the satire is very serious throughout and the comedy is used for comic relief purposes in order to keep the drama from getting too dark and brooding. In my opinion, this style of satire is worse than a tongue-in-cheek satire as the writers can get away with less social criticism while being serious and can often come across as pushing an agenda or a message way too hard on its viewers. As the message is often constituted by platitudes as well, the satire becomes very watered down and safe, which is the opposite purpose of satire. You want it to be provoking, so that it can spawn a debate regarding the issues at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 6,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The premise and the subject matter are definitely really good and the drama builds to become a lot better towards the back half but the editing mistakes and choices along with the overtness of the comedy-less satire and the message it is trying to put forth makes the drama drop off in quality, at least to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Her Private Life - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romcom, slice of life drama about a painter who meets a curator by profession, fangirl by lifestyle, whereupon they fall in love at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The color grading in the drama is really visually pleasing, making each color pop. As there is so much focus on color and how it is assigned and associated with different characters, it fits perfectly here. How this is done is that you isolate a certain color and then you grade them individually in a digital program to create different effects. In combination with the set design often having quite neutral backgrounds it allows for certain colors to really stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The main leads have so many great scenes together thanks to good editing choices, acting and writing. The silence in intimate scenes is really effectful. It creates so much more tension than just blasting “romantic/emotional” music. It really gives the chemistry between the two leads room to shine and boy does it shine. Kim Jae Wook as Ryan Gold and Park Min Young as Sung Deok Mi both do a fantastic job at portraying a couple that is truly in love. Park Min Young is experienced in being the leading lady in romcoms and always puts up a good performance, whereas Kim Jae Wook really surprised with this being his first real romcom and yet he knocked it out of the park. The writing of the main characters really help as well since the couple is written to be reliant on each other but still keep their own autonomy. I really enjoy that they feel like equals in their relationship. Yes, Ryan is technically Deok Mi’s boss but it rarely feels like he uses his position to force Deok Mi things she wouldn’t otherwise do. They are both respectful towards each other and impossibly cute together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) “Her Private Life” reminds me a lot of shoujo manga/anime or a Jane Austen novel in its storytelling. A lot of the story is just looking into the mind of the main female protagonist and getting to know her emotions, her longing and her dreams. Much of the interesting parts of this character driven drama takes place in their minds and it is visualized very well through the scenes of the fantasy scenarios of different characters and what happens on the fan page Deok Mi runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some slice of life aspects to the show which means it has a quiet and slow type of story focusing on rather ordinary people. It&amp;#39;s not meant to be an epic love story or heartbreaking melodrama, and it doesn&amp;#39;t throw in a crime subplot just for the heck of it. Some might view this type of story as boring, I see it as endearing and charming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Some of the product placement is really well done. The Canon cameras are among the most natural product placement I’ve seen in kdrama. Great choice of sponsor and they make the products essentially an accessory that fits in the story with both the fangirling aspect of the show as well as the photography/art side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the Canon product placement is done well, a lot of product placement in this drama is very in your face without any integration into the story or subtlety. I understand that unless the drama is a historical one, there will be product placement. However, there are creative and good ways to incorporate it into the drama, like they did with the Canon cameras. At times, the sponsorships of the drama are really aggravating and in your face which impacts the enjoyability of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Some of the characters outside of the main couple are shallowly written. The “brother” character Eun Gi has some really shallow writing and very few character traits. He likes judo and Deok Mi, that’s it. The actor Ahn Bohyun who plays Eun Gi is also a noticeably less experienced actor with this being one of his first main roles. This really shows in the scenes with the family when being on screen at the same time as Deok Mi’s parents played by Kim Mi Kyung and Maeng Sang Hoon, both of which are fantastic. There are other very shallowly written characters in the drama as well such as Da In. However, since she at least knows what she is doing to keep Ryan and Deok Mi from each other is wrong, as well as her being a supporting character, unlike Eun Gi, I am more forgiving about her character. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The camera work frustrates me at times. In some of the intimate scenes between Deok Mi and Ryan they keep spinning the camera around the couple, breaking the 180 degree rule multiple times and making the viewer disoriented and almost dizzy. I get that they are trying to be dramatic about their kissing but I would liked it better if they toned it down just a bit in favor of better camera work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The last quarter of the drama really drops off in terms of writing. Who asked for a &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;prolonged childhood connection and backstory&lt;/span&gt; arc? Not me, that’s for sure. Since the drama is adapted from the novel “Noona fan dot com” (2007) and I haven’t read the novel, I’m not sure if this unnecessary part of the story is a byproduct of making a faithful adaptation or not. Nevertheless, there are a lot of other more interesting things they could have explored such as &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Ryan’s inability to paint and following his rehabilitation helped by Deok Mi, instead of just having him miraculously be able to paint again.&lt;/span&gt; Even if they were dead set on having &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the childhood backstory &lt;/span&gt;arc play out, they could have executed it way better as it currently requires a lot of suspension of disbelief and doesn’t add anything important to the characterization of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama is a really great romcom drama that unfortunately falls off a fair bit towards the last quarter of the show. On the whole, it is still a very enjoyable drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My First First Love (Season 1) - Netflix&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coming of age, slice of life, romance drama about a group of college aged friends who end up living together and experience love, friendship and life as young adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The first episode does a really excellent job of establishing the characters and the setting and keeping a good balance between exposition and hooking the viewer in. To start with, the cinematography really keeps up with the urgency of the story. The scenes flow into each other in a very natural way, which I think is a byproduct of not having commercial breaks. We are shown the different characters’ backgrounds and their variation in socioeconomic status and yet they all end up in the same place as they all have pretty good motivations for leaving home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) For the most part, I really like the cinematography. I enjoy how some shots linger after the characters go off-screen and then fades into a flashback from the same place is exquisite film making. Sure it’s been done before by why not borrow inspiration if it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like the amount of extreme close ups they use to really emphasis the actions of characters in certain shots. It can be such ordinary things as opening a bag or twisting the accelerator on the scooter or something as moving as wiping someone’s tears away. It makes the drama feel more alive as there is more motion in the frame and allows for some sequences with fast cuts to add to the motion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drama also makes good use of the basics of different angled shots. When the characters are down on their luck it shows us them from above looking down on them making us see them as vulnerable. When they are standing up for someone it shows us them from below looking up on the which makes them look powerful. It is also used in conversations when the angle switches depending on the mood of the current speaker when one character is sad and the other is happy, which is pretty clever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The continuity control is pretty tight in this drama, well done to the script supervisor for making sure it is pretty free from any continuity errors. The level of drinks in non-opaque glasses tend to stay the same, a character who gets hit actually has marks from it later on and there are no major flubs with any props as far as I noticed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The story is set up to turn out in two different ways in season 2, both of which would be quite interesting. As it is a remake of the 2015 drama ”Because this is the first time”, the writer could choose to keep the original ending from that drama which is a pretty unique ending in the context of kdramas. However, they could also decide to change the ending to be different than the original drama which I would see as surprising but still plausible. No matter which route they decided to go down, I will be happy either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) As it is a season 1, it ends on a cliffhanger and we will have to wait for the resolve until the release of season 2 which has its official release date set to July 26. They’ve had the entire drama filmed already and the reason for splitting it into two parts is probably to give time for post production to do their magic as well as build up hype for the ending of the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) I wish they would chill with the lens flare and the super bright color grading. It’s like every time there is sun outside they feel the need to use lens flares and if the sun is coming in through a window, they use really bright filters in post production to drown the characters in light. This is clearly a stylistic choice and while I respect their choice, I don’t agree with it personally. It’s just not an aesthetic that I tend to be drawn towards as it creates less depth within a picture as the contours don’t show as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The roles that the main cast play aren’t the most challenging. Ji Soo is the one who shines the brightest but it feels like the role of Tae Oh is not letting him live up to his potential. The one role that required the most range was Jung Chaeyeon’s role as Song-i but I don’t feel like she delivered as well as I wished. For instance, Song-i’s most emotional and hard hitting scene is the bridge scene in episode 2. It’s good, but mainly thanks to the lines being really well written and the context of the scene rather than Chaeyeon’s performance being spectacular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The character Se Hyon is just such a drag and we have to wait until next season until we find out why she is so unlikable to everyone around her. It’s a bit of a shame for the actress who plays her, Hong Ji Yoon, as she tends to be typecast to play vain and antagonistic characters. As it stands, her motivations are never made clear and she exists merely to be a pebble in Song-i’s shoe. I have a feeling her character might also have the purpose of teaching Tae Oh a valuable lesson about love. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In his desperate search for a girlfriend who is everything he dreamed of, he only finds pain and potentially even loses the girl he has always been truly in love with in order to seek a perfect love that doesn’t exist.&lt;/span&gt; However, this remains to be seen in the second season and until it is revealed what her character arc is like, her character feels like a bit of a hollow shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) As the show has a heavy romance focus, the characters who are not part of any romance get a bit shafted for story development and screen time despite being main characters. The characters Choi Hoon and especially Oh Ga Rin suffer from this and for a drama with an ensemble cast to work really well, all the characters in the ensemble have to get the chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a well shot drama with a quiet everyday story. It’s not fantastic and it does have its flaws but overall it does a good job of portraying young adult romance and friendships. I can imagine this drama being a good palate cleanser after watching something intense.&lt;/p&gt;

Her Private Life is my 9th K-Drama (yes I do count,I like to keep track of what I’m watching)But I just need to get this off my chest on what a great actor Kim Jae Wook is I’m not a fan, but I just admire his work as an artist.

First off - a bit of background. I’m a Scottish woman in my late twenties. I’m not new to watching foreign films or Asian media - I’ve been watching anime and reading manga/manhwa on and off for about ten years, through various stages of obsession. I read (and loved) Cheese in the Trap years ago but have not seen the drama yet. I also had a stage about three years ago of watching every Korean horror/thriller movie I could get my hands on. Some deeper background - as you can tell from what I just said, I cannot - CANNOT - enjoy things casually. If I like something, that thing takes over my life for a period of time until I feel like I know enough to be able to say I’m a fan. I feel like I’m finally coming down from the KDrama high I have been riding for the past 4 months, so I want to reflect a bit on how it’s affected me. 

1. I am planning to open up a bookshop this year, so when I saw ‘Romance is a Bonus Book’ on Netflix, I was slightly intrigued. I like romance, I like books, I liked the fact it was only 16 episodes. At this point, I knew very little about Korean drama. I’d tried to watch a Japanese drama set in a bookshop years ago and got about 2 episodes through it, so I was sort of expecting the same reaction to this show. WELL. I binged it in the space of a couple of days. At the time, it was one of the best things I’d seen. But now that I’ve watched a bunch of other dramas, it’s probably way down the list. The MDL rating I gave it immediately after watching it: 8.5. I’d probably give it about 7.5 or 8 now, but it holds a special place in my heart. 

2. Next up! ‘Strong Woman Do Bong Soon’. This was super cute. I thought it was hilarious. I was also used to the slapstick comedy of the gangsters because I’ve seen a few Korean films that have the same weird incongruity of dark themes with ridiculous humour where people hurt themselves in increasingly funny ways. The times where Bong Soon and Min Hyuk stop and stare at each other for like 2 minutes at a time was a bit ‘eh?’ to me, a person who is mostly used to British and American shows where kissing and sex happens all the time. I couldn’t get over the cuteness though, I felt like my heart was being literally squeezed at times. I kept rewatching the cute scenes. I’ve never done that with Western shows. Strong Woman Do Bong Soon made me realise that I now had a new obsession in the form of Korean (at this point, romance) drama. I felt like it was written for women in a way that most things aren’t, which made is seem incredibly accessible to me despite the fact that I’m probably not the targeted cultural audience. MDL rating I gave it immediately after watching: 9.5. Realistically, it could probably be lower, but these ratings are based purely on how I feel, and do not follow any kind of logical system, so you can pry the huge amount of love I have for this show out of my cold, dead hands.

3. ‘Weightlifting Fairy Kim Bok Joo’. Similar vibes to Bong Soon for me. Bad-ass female characters with love interests who find them super fucking adorable. I was quickly learning that this kind of dynamic is my absolute jam. SWAG. MDL Rating: 9.0.

4. Reply 1988. Holy. Crap. I cried non-stop for the last three episodes, and the episodes are damn long okay. After watching it, I did some research and realised most people were upset that &gt;!Deok-sun ended up with Taek instead of Jung-hwan. I was not upset, I thought Taek and Deok-sun had something special, but I also love Jung-hwan and yes I feel his ending could have improved but since they never explicitly stated what happened to him, I just assume he is living his best life and am all the happier for it.!&lt; I literally still watch certain scenes on YouTube of this show. The performance the guys did for Deok-sun’s talent show so she could win the tape player? Art. Any scene with Dong-ryong singing/dancing? Hilarious. I even loved all the scenes with the mums cutting vegetables and saying ‘aigoooo’ every ten seconds, that’s how I much I loved this drama. It was so beautiful. It was hilarious. MDL Rating: the first 10.

5. Suspicious Partner. The MDL rating I gave for this show after watching is was 8.0 but I feel like I was unfair because it had the crap luck to be watched straight after Reply 1988. Honestly, Ji Chang Wook is gorgeous, the kiss scenes were great, and I feel like it’s another show like Bong Soon that had that incongruity between serious/cutesy scenes. 

6. You Who Came From The Stars. Okay, so. The thing I remember the most about this show is the main dude kept having shower scenes where he was wearing a towel around his waist. It also seemed pretty cliche, but that obviously didn’t deter me because I would have killed for the two leads, and spent an inordinate amount crying over them. MDL Rating: 8.5

7. Reply 1994. I still missed Reply 1988. I was happy just to see Lee Il-hwa and Sung Dong-il being parents again. I did like it. But more likely because I like most things. I think if I stopped watching it half way through, I wouldn’t have felt the need to pick it back up again, but I was deep in my obsession at this point. MDL Rating: 8.5.

7. SIDE NOTE: At some point in between these shows I started watching Doctor Stranger and dropped it. I found the plot pretty ridiculous, almost like an American soap opera. Which is a shame because I found the bits in Pyongyang fascinating. 
8. Reply 1997. I am pretty sure I liked this better than Reply 1994, but for some reason I’ve also rated it 8.5. Maybe I liked it better in hindsight. Or maybe this is proof that my rating system really is a failure and should definitely be ignored. I really appreciated the chemistry between the two leads, but the same with the other two Reply series, it KINDA BOTHERS ME THAT THEY ARE IN LOVE AND THEN WAIT YEARS TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. But that doesn’t detract from all the other great things about them. Because of this show I ended up watching another Seo In-guk drama.

9. Shopping King Louie. (MDL: 9.5 - don’t judge me.) Again, I loved this, the romance was cute, it was kinda problematic… kinda really problematic, but I just didn’t take it seriously and enjoyed it for what it was. An opportunity to properly crush on Seo In-guk. Leading to…

10. The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. Jesus. First Melodrama. I wish I could have been warned about how much this would hurt!! I can’t believe it. Every other show I had watched until that point, everyone lived happily ever after, I wasn’t expecting this pain. Couldn’t stop thinking about it for days afterwards. MDL Rating: 8.5. 

11. Fight For My Way. Guys… GUYS. Park Seo Joon is literally everything in this drama. EVERYTHING. I loved this so damn much - the chemistry between the four main leads was insane. I felt like they’d literally been friends for years. I laughed so hard constantly in the first few episodes, then things started to hurt in the best way. Seol Hee was a bit of a scene stealer for me, I wanted her to be eternally happy. The relationship between Dong Man and Ae Ra was everything I want to see when I watch drama. I also liked that there were no chaebols, these characters were struggling in a very real way that other people in their 20s struggle. The only thing that was a bit off was the minor plot twist at the end with the landlady ahjumma, but I just forget it happened and don’t let it impact my feelings on the rest of the story. MDL Rating: 10.0

12. What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim? Did I like this show? Of course, it has Park Seo Joon in it. MDL Rating: 8.0

13. I’m Not A Robot. This was such a fresh concept, I liked this show a lot. Even though I really enjoyed it while watching it, I don’t really have much to say about it?? This was another one that surprisingly hit me hard in the feels. MDL Rating: 9.5. 

14. Because This Is My First Life. Ahhh, this was so gentle and lovely. A different kind of romance, but one that I feel needs it place beside the more dramatic love stories. Lee Min Ki is an incredible actor because I felt like I could understand his feelings even when he was being completely stone faced. Side note: MoonMoon’s song ‘Marriage’ from the OST is a beautiful song that sits with ‘Don’t Worry’ by Lee Juck from the Reply 1988 OST as two songs that I listen to on repeat on days when I’m feeling mopey. MDL Rating: 9.5

15. Healer. Ji Chang Wook, you gorgeous man. Also, Park Min Young - I get the hype now. I loved her character in this (a lot more than I liked her character in Secretary Kim). This was just good fun, despite all the hidden identities, casual stalking, fucked up family dynamics, etc. It was cute! I like seeing Ji Chang Wook dressed all in black beating up bad guys! A good time. MDL: 10.0

16. Another Miss Oh. I was so happy to see Ahjumma from Healer again. She made Hae Young’s mum a likeable character in a way that she might not have been if someone else played her? At least in the first few episodes. I liked that the main characters were very obviously flawed, and I liked the fact that Hae Young was not shy about her emotions. She was a bit crazy in a way we don’t see typical drama female leads being crazy. I rooted for them. It also felt like… I was watching a show with two secondary leads which was interesting. MDL: 9.0

17. Goblin. Oh my gosh. This beautiful drama. The production value was seriously so high, it was stunning. Before I watched it I thought it was going to be a very serious show at all times, but it was surprisingly freaking funny. I fell in love with everyone. I cried so hard. Grim Reaper and Goblin had such good chemistry. This show was intense, my love for it is intense. MDL: 10.0

18. Thirty But Seventeen. This was cute and kinda heartbreaking. Yang Se Jong is beautiful, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I’m a sucker for the found family trope. MDL: 9.0

19. Prison Playbook. I just finished this, and I think I need a break from other dramas for a few days to get my head around how much this show meant to me. This might potentially top Reply 1988. I felt personally invested in so many of the characters lives. It’s like Orange is the New Black but Korean and with men, and with a likeable main character instead. Lieutenant Paeng &lt;3 Jailbird &lt;3 Joon-ho&lt;3 Min-chul &lt;3 Jung-woo &lt;3 HANYANG &lt;3 This is the show I would recommend to people who have never seen a Korean drama before, as well as recommend it to people who have seen lots, as well as recommend you to rewatch it if you’ve seen it before. It was well-rounded perfection. I need time to recover from how amazing it was. 

Shows I have started that have been (lovingly) left behind and which I plan to pick back up at some point when I am in the right mood for them:

Love in the Moonlight. Park Bo Gum is a beautiful person, I honestly only have like 3 episodes of this show left, but I stopped watching it about two months ago and have yet to pick it up.

Eulachacha Waikiki. I have seen two episodes and laughed almost the whole way through but I guess I wasn’t in a comedy mood at the time.

The Guest. I love horror. This is a good horror show. I unfortunately started watching it when I was trying to stop watching so much romance but romance won in the end. I will pick this back up the next time I’m looking for something dark and miserable to watch.

Go Back Couple. Honestly, I don’t know why I stopped watching this, I need to pick it up again.

My First First Love. Started watching for Ji Soo. Not incredibly interested in it, but I only have about 3 episodes left to go. 

If writing all this out has proven anything, it’s that I have too many positive feelings, and would do well to dislike things more so that I can really truly differentiate between my favourite things and things I didn’t like as much. My rating system is a joke, so don’t come for me. One thing I’m sure of: all my tens deserve to be tens.

Other impacts that KDrama has had in my life: 

I read Human Acts by Han Kang, about the 80s uprisings in Korea and it’s a gorgeous and incredibly depressing book that I treasure but cannot recommend to most people because of how depressing and grim it is. 

I now do finger hearts but have to constantly explain what they are to people.

I have fallen into the blackhole with BTS and am genuinely scared to branch out into other Kpop in case I like other bands just as much.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started watching Korean drama earlier this year and I wanted to write a little bit about my experience with it!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reply 1997. I am pretty sure I liked this better than Reply 1994, but for some reason I’ve also rated it 8.5. Maybe I liked it better in hindsight. Or maybe this is proof that my rating system really is a failure and should definitely be ignored. I really appreciated the chemistry between the two leads, but the same with the other two Reply series, it KINDA BOTHERS ME THAT THEY ARE IN LOVE AND THEN WAIT YEARS TO DO ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT. But that doesn’t detract from all the other great things about them. Because of this show I ended up watching another Seo In-guk drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shopping King Louie. (MDL: 9.5 - don’t judge me.) Again, I loved this, the romance was cute, it was kinda problematic… kinda really problematic, but I just didn’t take it seriously and enjoyed it for what it was. An opportunity to properly crush on Seo In-guk. Leading to…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Smile Has Left Your Eyes. Jesus. First Melodrama. I wish I could have been warned about how much this would hurt!! I can’t believe it. Every other show I had watched until that point, everyone lived happily ever after, I wasn’t expecting this pain. Couldn’t stop thinking about it for days afterwards. MDL Rating: 8.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fight For My Way. Guys… GUYS. Park Seo Joon is literally everything in this drama. EVERYTHING. I loved this so damn much - the chemistry between the four main leads was insane. I felt like they’d literally been friends for years. I laughed so hard constantly in the first few episodes, then things started to hurt in the best way. Seol Hee was a bit of a scene stealer for me, I wanted her to be eternally happy. The relationship between Dong Man and Ae Ra was everything I want to see when I watch drama. I also liked that there were no chaebols, these characters were struggling in a very real way that other people in their 20s struggle. The only thing that was a bit off was the minor plot twist at the end with the landlady ahjumma, but I just forget it happened and don’t let it impact my feelings on the rest of the story. MDL Rating: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim? Did I like this show? Of course, it has Park Seo Joon in it. MDL Rating: 8.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m Not A Robot. This was such a fresh concept, I liked this show a lot. Even though I really enjoyed it while watching it, I don’t really have much to say about it?? This was another one that surprisingly hit me hard in the feels. MDL Rating: 9.5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because This Is My First Life. Ahhh, this was so gentle and lovely. A different kind of romance, but one that I feel needs it place beside the more dramatic love stories. Lee Min Ki is an incredible actor because I felt like I could understand his feelings even when he was being completely stone faced. Side note: MoonMoon’s song ‘Marriage’ from the OST is a beautiful song that sits with ‘Don’t Worry’ by Lee Juck from the Reply 1988 OST as two songs that I listen to on repeat on days when I’m feeling mopey. MDL Rating: 9.5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healer. Ji Chang Wook, you gorgeous man. Also, Park Min Young - I get the hype now. I loved her character in this (a lot more than I liked her character in Secretary Kim). This was just good fun, despite all the hidden identities, casual stalking, fucked up family dynamics, etc. It was cute! I like seeing Ji Chang Wook dressed all in black beating up bad guys! A good time. MDL: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another Miss Oh. I was so happy to see Ahjumma from Healer again. She made Hae Young’s mum a likeable character in a way that she might not have been if someone else played her? At least in the first few episodes. I liked that the main characters were very obviously flawed, and I liked the fact that Hae Young was not shy about her emotions. She was a bit crazy in a way we don’t see typical drama female leads being crazy. I rooted for them. It also felt like… I was watching a show with two secondary leads which was interesting. MDL: 9.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goblin. Oh my gosh. This beautiful drama. The production value was seriously so high, it was stunning. Before I watched it I thought it was going to be a very serious show at all times, but it was surprisingly freaking funny. I fell in love with everyone. I cried so hard. Grim Reaper and Goblin had such good chemistry. This show was intense, my love for it is intense. MDL: 10.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty But Seventeen. This was cute and kinda heartbreaking. Yang Se Jong is beautiful, I couldn’t stop looking at him. I’m a sucker for the found family trope. MDL: 9.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prison Playbook. I just finished this, and I think I need a break from other dramas for a few days to get my head around how much this show meant to me. This might potentially top Reply 1988. I felt personally invested in so many of the characters lives. It’s like Orange is the New Black but Korean and with men, and with a likeable main character instead. Lieutenant Paeng &amp;lt;3 Jailbird &amp;lt;3 Joon-ho&amp;lt;3 Min-chul &amp;lt;3 Jung-woo &amp;lt;3 HANYANG &amp;lt;3 This is the show I would recommend to people who have never seen a Korean drama before, as well as recommend it to people who have seen lots, as well as recommend you to rewatch it if you’ve seen it before. It was well-rounded perfection. I need time to recover from how amazing it was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shows I have started that have been (lovingly) left behind and which I plan to pick back up at some point when I am in the right mood for them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love in the Moonlight. Park Bo Gum is a beautiful person, I honestly only have like 3 episodes of this show left, but I stopped watching it about two months ago and have yet to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eulachacha Waikiki. I have seen two episodes and laughed almost the whole way through but I guess I wasn’t in a comedy mood at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Guest. I love horror. This is a good horror show. I unfortunately started watching it when I was trying to stop watching so much romance but romance won in the end. I will pick this back up the next time I’m looking for something dark and miserable to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go Back Couple. Honestly, I don’t know why I stopped watching this, I need to pick it up again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My First First Love. Started watching for Ji Soo. Not incredibly interested in it, but I only have about 3 episodes left to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If writing all this out has proven anything, it’s that I have too many positive feelings, and would do well to dislike things more so that I can really truly differentiate between my favourite things and things I didn’t like as much. My rating system is a joke, so don’t come for me. One thing I’m sure of: all my tens deserve to be tens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other impacts that KDrama has had in my life: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read Human Acts by Han Kang, about the 80s uprisings in Korea and it’s a gorgeous and incredibly depressing book that I treasure but cannot recommend to most people because of how depressing and grim it is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now do finger hearts but have to constantly explain what they are to people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have fallen into the blackhole with BTS and am genuinely scared to branch out into other Kpop in case I like other bands just as much.&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office""&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/a&gt; episodes 12 - 14 and vote for our next drama. &lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

#####Ratings

#####General Tips and Tricks 

* Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/).

Okay so you know what I think would make an AWESOME kdrama idea (obviously my mind is trying to think of anything else than waiting) 

 I think it would be cool if there was a drama where the secretary and ceo WERE really just awesome partners at work, and like, best friends because they work so well together, and each other’s confidant as they navigated their own individual romances - like the secretary could have a love hate relationship with a manager of a rival company, who she keeps going toe to toe with to protect HER ceo, and he could have a romance with like, some coffee shop worker or something who gets the wrong idea and thinks he’s a barista too 😂😂 and the roles could be reversed, female ceo and guy secretary, but I just really crave a healthy working partnership sometimes in these dramas and there’s a certain ick factor to me when the ceo falls for the girl who spends her life doing his bidding - and vice versa

So that’s my wish/rant, if anyone else is entertained! The closest I’ve seen is What Happens to my Family, with the original ceo (not the son).

As usual, let's get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**March**

&amp;#x200B;

**He Is Psychometric - TvN**

Sci-fi crime drama with elements of comedy and romance about a young man with the power to see past events just by touching objects or people.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) I really enjoy the recurring metaphor of a bird being tied down by chains inside of a cage and the notion that even if we want to leave we can’t as we are all tied down to something. In the case of the characters in this show, they are all tied down to the events of the past. &gt;!Seong Mo and his mother are still affected by the physical chains and abuse Seong Mo’s father put them through. Seong Mo’s father in return is still tied to the enslavement he experienced in his childhood. Ahn and Jae In had their lives altered by the apartment complex fire and to this day it is something that they can’t let go off. Ji Soo and her father are still tied to the father’s corrupt dealings in the past which restrict them.!&lt; There are other nice metaphors as well such as the trap, sail and anchor metaphor, but the bird in the cage was the one that really stuck with me.

(2) Although the main actors are young, they put in a good performance. Shin Yeeun, playing the role of the smart girl Yoon Jae In looking to fight crime, is actually a really good rookie actress. I’ve previously seen her in her breakout role in the hit webdrama “A-teen” (2018) where she was quite noticeably the brightest star. I was curious as to how she would transition into a full scale TV production and I think she managed just fine. Playing opposite her is Park Jinyoung who plays Lee Ahn, a boy with psychometric powers that allow him to see past events just by touching objects or people. This is Park Jinyoung’s second main role in a TV production, after having many support roles earlier on. Both of the main leads have big roles to play that are not easy by any stretch of the imagination. Jinyoung needs to play a playful goofball without overplaying and also display a ton of depth and trauma. Meanwhile, Yeeun needs to play a withdrawn and calculative police officer while not coming of as plain at the same time as she needs to display both sadness and a lust for revenge. Overall, I think they both managed this quite well.

(3) The fight scenes are few and far between but when they decide to throw one in it is well executed. There is one fight scene in particular that takes place in a narrow corridor that is really  nicely choreographed and well shot with two of the main leads fighting a bunch of henchmen. Obviously, it is not as sick as other iconic corridor fight scenes like in “Old Boy” (2003) or Netflix’s “Daredevil” (2015) but it is fairly well done and a quite memorable scene from the drama. The main difference maker is that those were both shot in one extended take whereas this is is more fine tuned and polished with many different shots, which takes away from the rawness of the scene.

(4) The establishment of characters and exposition is really smooth. It definitely uses “show don’t tell” in a textbook way. It tells us through the set design what the conflict in the Yeongsang apartment complex revolves around. Through the cinematography, it becomes clear to us that Ahn and Seong Mo have become brothers. We don’t need to see the whole process of them deciding to live together. Instead, that scene is shown to us later when it has more of an emotional impact. I also enjoy how  Ahn’s powers are established to be very underdeveloped to begin with due to him avoiding physical contact as much as he can. He doesn’t start out being this really powerful protagonist, instead we get to follow him on his hero’s journey.

(5) The show uses color grading to great effect. In case you didn’t know, color grading video is a digital technique that is done after filming and changes the color tone and mood of the film and was pioneered by the Oscar winner ”Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?” in the year 2000. In “He is Psychometric”’s flashback scenes, color grading is used to give everything a sort of yellow tint which gives of a nostalgic feeling, indicating visually that what you are watching took place in the past. In certain scenes, the color grading is really amped up to nine, only focusing on highlight a certain color or a certain object while leaving the rest of the shot monochromatic. Impactful imagery such as blood, fire or light is usually what is highlighted during these sequences of extreme color grading.

(6) The show uses dolly shots to creative effect. A dolly shot is executed by zooming in or out with the camera while moving the camera forwards or backwards on a track. The result is that the foreground stays in the same position while the background appears to squeeze or stretch. Usually this is done in relation to Ahn’s psychometry which gives us a sense that he is focused on what he is doing but at the same time emphasising to us how dizzy his powers make him.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The genre mix between romcom and crime thriller requires the viewer to enjoy both genres and how the drama executes them. Fortunately for me, I do enjoy both genres and think the drama executed both genres pretty well. I appreciate that they didn’t jump back and forth a whole lot between being comedic and dark instead there was a proper transition from leaning in a more light hearted direction to a more serious direction. However, I see why the genre mix would be off putting to viewers who just want to see a romcom or just want to see a crime drama.

(2) The twist is not surprising at all. Pretty early on, it becomes clear that there are only two people that would have motive to &gt;!fake the death of Prosecutor Seong Mo’s mom: Seong Mo and the mom. Once we learn about just how frail of a mental state the mother is in, it’s confirmed that the prosecutor was the one to fake his mother’s death by killing the women’s group and starting the apartment complex fire. From early on, it is also quite apparent from the editing where the camera lingers on Seong Mo then and cuts to menacing imagery that he is either a red herring or guilty in some way. The only question that remains afterwards is how involved he is in the murders and fires.!&lt;

(3) Some writing decisions felt like they were done purely to get a reaction out of the audience. For instance, &gt;!killing off Kim Da Som’s character, detective Eun Ji Soo, has little effect on the story. It doesn’t establish how violent the main antagonist is since we already know he is ruthless. The only thing that it really has an effect on is Ji Soo’s father deciding to out the corrupt actions of himself and the construction company.!&lt; Comparatively, there are other kdramas that have managed to &gt;!kill off main characters!&lt; to great effect where one &gt;!character’s death!&lt; has a massive impact on multiple facets of the story.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,5 / 10* \- I enjoyed many aspects of the drama and with stronger writing it could have been a nine or higher.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Doctor Prisoner - KBS2**

Medical thriller drama about a doctor out to get revenge on those who made him lose his medical license.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The lighting in this drama in a bunch of scenes is 0% realism and 100% aesthetic, and I dig the hell out of that. Some scenes are just pure darkness that is drenched in yellow light and it looks so sick. Whether it be inside the prison or an interrogation room in the prosecutor's office, the heavily stylized lighting and color palette is featured which makes the drama stand out visually and really stick with you in your mind. It becomes a signature of the drama, through which you know they did a good job creating a unique art direction when it becomes so iconic and synonymous with the drama itself.

(2) The cast is ridiculously stacked with great actors and actresses. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you just picked out some of the actors from stellar dramas like Signal, Stranger, SKY Castle and the likes, then put them in the same drama. You get a show that is as well acted as Doctor Prisoner. The three men at the forefront, Nam Goong Min as the vindictive Dr. Na Yi Je, Choi Won Young as the power hungry CEO Lee Jae Joon and Kim Byung Chul as prison director Seon Min Sik, all put up ridiculously good performances. The ladies in the spotlight were no joke either, as Jin Hee Kyung, Lee Da In and even Nara, considering her lack of acting experience, did very well for themselves in their respective scenes.

(3) The plot is absolutely bonkers in the best way possible. There are about three plot twist per episode as the different characters try to mess with one another to outsmart or one up each other. There are not any established teams but instead the characters switch their allegiances when it suits their personal interest which I found both realistic and fascinating. In many cases, you are not quite sure whether you can fully trust a character, which is a good thing as it adds to the suspense. None of the characters are purely good or purely evil and there is always a reason behind why a character acts a certain way, which means that while you may hate a character because of their vile actions, you come to understand their motivations. While the different characters’ motivations are never muddled, they are not obvious to the point that the plot becomes predictable. The only thing you can really predict with one hundred percent accuracy is that the plot will remain unpredictable.

(4) It breaks the mold of the genre. I can confidently state that I usually don’t like medical dramas. However, I loved Doctor Prisoner since it strays away from the usual way a medical drama plays out. Firstly, the setting is not just a regular hospital as it takes place in a prison. Resources are scarce and the doctors have to make due with what they got in order to save their patients instead of relying on top-notch equipment. Since it takes place in a prison, there are also additional dangers as the patients and the people around them can be quite cumbersome. Just like the prisoners, the doctors also play by prison rules and occasionally throw ethics out of the window to further their own interest. Secondly, the conflict is seldom just “this patient has X symptoms, we have to solve it”, there are always additional layers behind how the patient came to be ill and why they absolutely need to be saved despite being criminals. There is always a main overarching conflict in the power struggle to hold power over a prison or a hospital or a company. Lastly, they managed to make a medical drama into more of a thriller instead of focusing largely on romance or melodrama like many medical dramas do, which is why I found it easier to digest and more unique.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) Some of the cast is underutilized, especially Nara’s character Han So Geum. A lot of the show’s focus is on the power struggle between the three gentlemen Na Yi Je, Lee Jae Joon and Seon Min Sik all looking to one up each other. As a result, even though Nara has a main role on the billing credits, she is pushed to the side quite a lot. Perhaps it is because she doesn’t quite have the same experience and resume that the other main actors have, in any case, she feels more like a supporting character. If one were to look at the drama from a gender perspective, it is a very male centered drama, which is unfortunate but fairly accurate considering the balance of genders in director and CEO positions in South Korea.

(2) The same thing applies to the comedy in this drama like what I wrote about the comedy in Kingdom. I personally don’t mind it, but I understand that if you are looking for a dark drama purely free from comedy, then the occasional comic relief would be a drawback. I felt like they went about the comedy bits in a tasteful way though and in my opinion, they added to the show more than they took away from it.

(3) The soundtrack isn’t all that. There is one main score that is played throughout the drama which is alright in itself but it becomes a bit repetitive. In suspenseful scenes, they always blast the sound of a heart rate monitor beeping loudly instead of an actual OST. The beeping ends up feeling overused towards the back half of the series as they use it at least once per episode.

(4) For once, I didn’t feel like the drama was too long but instead too short. The series was supposed to be extended for 2 episodes but ended up being reduced back to 32 episodes, which resulted in some questions being left unanswered by the plot. However, with the immense popularity of the drama in South Korea, a possible sequel is on the table, &gt;!especially considering the way the drama ended.!&lt; Perhaps some of the loose threads will be tied up then, but for now we are left wondering what happened to certain characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 9,5 / 10* \- The drama has enough small flaws not to warrant it a perfect score of ten out of ten, but it does come very close and it is surely a stand out drama of the year that you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching if you like a thrilling and tightly written story.

&amp;#x200B;

**Confession - TvN**

Legal crime drama about a lawyer seeking the truth behind a murder that resulted in his father ending up on death row.

Large thanks to r/KDRAMA ’s very own u/ordinaryguy92 for ripping and syncing the sub as this drama was never officially licensed.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The drama includes some really good courtroom scenes with solid logic behind the reasoning of the defense and the prosecution. Some of the social commentary is pretty solid as well, such as how corrupt people in power use celebrity scandals to control the media and distract the public from their own dirty deeds.

(2) The direction is on point. I wouldn’t expect any less coming from the director of Mother and Chicago Typewriter. Although the camera work is very intense with a lot of movement it manages it very well. Most of the time, the camera is slightly moving and zooming, creating urgency, fluidity and focus on whatever is currently important in the frame. Despite moving the camera a lot, there is rarely shaky cam (except for a few cases) or problems with blurry zooms or the focus being off. The camera movement is just really buttery which results in a very pleasant viewing experience. The drama also manages to use lens flare in a tasteful way that is not over the top with how in your face lens flare can be used for artistic effect.

(3) The writer Im Hee Cheol is pretty new to the scene but did an excellent job, proving that although experience is important, it is not everything. The story takes some twist and turns and it is not always obvious what is going to happen although yet the story progresses very naturally. It should be said though that some plot points are very obviously foreshadowed so if you are well versed in film and literature they should come as no surprise to you. One example of this is &gt;!the fact that Choi ’s father took the blame for killing the warrant officer in order to get his son a heart transplant which ended up with father being murdered. This is quite apparent already in episode 5 but they make it a big reveal of it in episode 11 and confirm it in episode 14. As a viewer you’re just left like: ”yes, we been knew for a while now”.!&lt;

(4) There are some great fake outs in this drama where something is introduced and thanks to the editing you think it will benefit or damage the protagonist but it turns out to do the opposite, resulting in some great reversals of expectations. One such occurrence is when it seems like a device is recording the protagonists conversation and it will end up hurting them but as it turns out that device was actually planted there by someone with the same goal as our heroes and it turns out the device contains important evidence.

(5) Lee Junho is pretty good at acting, the stereotype of ”idol actor” definitely does not apply to him. Although his character is quite reserved in this drama, he manages to avoid falling in to the trap of appearing to be wooden. You can tell on his face that there are plenty of emotions flowing within the character despite the calm and collected facade that would indicate otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama requires some suspension of disbelief. Some of the time aspects seem a bit off in order to make the story more interesting. A person of interest always arrive in court at the very last second and investigations are started late in order for them to finish right before the trial. Additionally as with all crime series, you have police officers, prosecutor and even crime scene investigators not wearing proper equipment for examining a crime scene and touching things in a crime scene with their bare hands. Once again, it ruins the immersion but it is something that you can look past once you suspend your disbelief.

(2) Although the camera movement is mostly really smooth, I wish they would have used more fixed shots for some scenes where constantly moving the camera adds little to nothing to the scene. It’s fine if you’re not actively thinking about it, but once you start analyzing the series shot by shot, it becomes slightly annoying. Additionally, the handheld shaky cam used in for instance chase scenes is such a stark contrast to the otherwise really smooth camera work.

(3) The sound mixing is a little uneven at points which makes it clear that some of the dubbed dialogue was recorded at different occasions as the sound level and quality varies between takes. For the uninitiated, the reason for dubbing over a scene while still using the original actors voice could be that the scene is recorded in a location that does not allow for good quality audio recordings due to for instance echo or strong wind.

(4) I’m not a big fan of the dramatic “sting” sound effect that they add whenever they need to up up the tension. It has become dime a dozen in almost every movie trailer these days but the usage of it especially in the actually series feels rather lazy and uninspired. The drama is exciting enough as it is, it doesn’t need this stinger sound whenever something important is revealed. Sure, these types of sound effects where fresh when used in movies that popularized them such as Transformers (2006) and Inception (2010), but around ten years later they’ve grown stale.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,5 / 10* \- I really enjoy the story but some of the production choices and misses really hinders my score from being any higher.

**Kill It - OCN**

Action thriller drama about a professional assassin trying to find out about his mysterious past.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The actors were well cast for their roles. Nana does a good job at portraying detective Do Hyun Jin despite not having many dramas on her resume previously. Jang Ki Yong is perfect for the role of an emotionless assassin such as the character of Kim Soo Hyun he plays here. Noh Jung Eui is great as the orphan Kang Seulgi considering she is only 17 years old, much thanks to her already extensive list of dramas that she has acted in during the last 8 years. Lee Jae Won is also a great fit as the mischievous hacker Phillip Ahn.

(2) The actors also had some pretty good chemistry with each other. Even though there is no romance in this drama, the tension between Hyun Jin and Soo Hyun is palpable and it feels like you can cut the atmosphere with a knife. Soo Hyun and Seulgi have a interesting relationship much like that of an older brother and a younger sister despite not being related. They take care of each other in different ways and bicker with one another just like siblings do. Hyun Jin and Seulgi have a somewhat love-hate relationship to one another as they start out as enemies but after a while they grow on each other. Soo Hyun and Phillip have some bromance and banter amongst each other in one scene and are at each others neck in the next one.

(3) “Kill It” has parallels to one of my favorite novels of the 21st century, in that one of the themes and plot line is quite similar. &gt;!The novel in question is “Never Let Me Go” (2005) from the Nobel prize winning author Kazuo Ishiguro. “Never Let Me Go” touches upon the use of cloning humans in order to harvest their organs. Although “Kill It” doesn’t have any cloning but it does focus on the ethics of using test tube children for the same purpose. Much like in “Never Let Me Go”, the children that are to be harvested for their organs are kept in an institution far away from the rest of civilization. Both of the stories deals with organ harvesting, medical ethics and research ethics and asks questions about the human condition like what is the worth of a human being and whether some people have an inherently higher worth than others.!&lt; I really enjoy this aspect of the drama.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The art direction and color palette of the drama is a huge let down. You know that really cool color palette of black, neon blue and neon pink that was on the poster for the show? Yea, that shows up in exactly one scene. A lot of the drama is just slathered in grey and brown going for the most generic art direction for a serious crime thriller.

(2) Probably the biggest issue is the writing of the show.  This is probably due to the screenwriters Choi Myung Jin and Son Hyun Soo being brand new to writing a drama, so one can understand why the series has its writing flaws as new writers usually need time to get really good.  Up until around the halfway mark of the story it isn’t too bad. However, after that is were it really starts to come apart in the seams. After half of the drama has passed too much information has already been relayed and the audience has already had almost everything revealed to them. They unraveled the plot in 6 episodes and after that we are left just watching the characters learn what we’ve already been clued in on.

(3) Characters are introduced to have traits that are never used for anything useful. Hyun Jin is shown to be excellent at throwing darts but never uses this skill for anything other than shutting up snarky colleagues. The characters are not strongly enough written to have many different facets to them and many of the characters outside of the main cast are very one-dimensional. As a result the characters do not drive the drama forward either when the plot is stalling. None of the characters go through major character development but stay rather static during the drama, with Seulgi being the only character to grow noticeably in the drama.

(4) The alternative title for this show is Blue Eyes, indicating that they are an important part to the story. Throughout the first episode, the editing also puts a lot of emphasis on the blue eyes, making the viewer think it will lead to something integral to the story. The only real tie-in to it during the rest of the show is that we briefly learn that the blue eyes are a &gt;!side effect of the artificial insemination and the test tube babies being developed in a lab.!&lt; This leaves us with the pressing question of what happened to Soo Hyun’s blue eyes, as he had them when he was around 10 and he doesn’t have them at adult age. This is never answered in the show despite putting a lot of focus on the blue eyes.

(5) The dialogue is a bit lacking and it has the typical kdrama issue of having many interactions being expressed purely through stares. It’s not quite at “Twilight” (2008) level of staring but there is still too much staring and too little dialogue for my liking. Especially since some of the dialogue is pretty decent, primarily the banter between the main characters.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 5,5 / 10* \- The concept was really cool, the casting was good and it touches on some interesting topics but the weak writing in regards to the plot and the characters in combination with a mostly uninspired art direction makes for a slightly below average drama.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Eulachacha Waikiki 2 - JTBC**

Sitcom drama about a group of friends living at a guest house who keep finding themselves caught up in wacky scenarios.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) It is quite unique in the sense that it is one of the only prime time sitcoms to air in the last couple of years. Yes, there are other comedy shows but very few use the sitcom format, which makes it stand out of the crowd in the kdrama landscape. As it is a sitcom, much of the comedy comes from the situations that the characters find themselves in. Many situations are also created by the characters through their lying and how the lying just keeps escalating is executed really well. Instead of causing frustrating misunderstandings it leads to ridiculously funny scenes.

(2) They use really cheesy effects in a good way, making them intentionally funny. For instance they use the classic comic book effect of a spark in the sky to indicate a home run. This shot isn’t meant to look good or realistic, it’s meant to be funny and it manages that well.

(3) They use contrastive humor really well. For instance when there is chaos in a scene and they make it into a montage and put cheery music over it. What adds to the hilariousness is that the main cast are all really good at body gags. Through just their facial expressions and bodies they convey comedy that is truly universal and crosses language barriers.

(4) The show integrates aspects that are staples of Korean variety shows. It is not the first drama to do this but it never fails to be funny. Examples includes such classics as blasting Careless Whisper by George Michael when something is implied to be erotic, or Mai Piu by Andrea Bocelli when someone is expecting something romantic, or She Is by Clazziquai Project when there is some implied guy-on-guy action.

(5) The referential humor is on point, when they referenced The Face Reader, I was rolling with laughter. Game of Thrones soundtrack when determining who will take the throne of being the most handsome. Something in the Rain soundtrack plays everytime there is hints of noona romance, that actually isn’t that romantic. There are so many other references in the drama as well, some of which include: Harry Potter, The Guest, SKY Castle, Suicide Squad, Forrest Gump, The X-Files, Kill Bill, Love Actually, and Kimi No Nawa.

(6) The show also manages to deliver some really heartfelt and touching moments in between all the silly wackiness. All of the main cast get to show of their weaknesses, their dreams and their aspirations which makes the viewer really connect with them. It gives the show a lot of heart and makes the joke really count.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) This show is riddled with plot holes and the story is definitely something that comes second whereas the comedy comes first. The natural progression of a story is thrown out of the window for the sake of comedy. While there is nothing inherently wrong with that, it would be more impressive if they could balance the two aspects at the same time.

(2) The comedy by repetition can be pretty funny, but at the same time it can also get really stale when they just spend too much time repeating the same joke over and over again. If you find the joke funny to begin with, it’s probably gonna get even funnier, but if you didn’t enjoy it, you’ll wish they just stopped.

(3) That one suicide joke in episode 14 just didn’t sit right with me. It felt so unnecessary. Considering the very high youth suicide rates in South Korea, I just cannot fathom why the writers would think this was a good idea. There is nothing wrong with dark comedy but when it comes out of left field in an otherwise lighthearted series it just feels out of place and unjustified.

(4) Due to its sitcom nature, the story lacks continuity. Unlike in season 1 where there is the baby left at the Waikiki guesthouse acting as an overarching plot thread that ties everything together, there is a lack of such a thing in season 2. That results in the story line not coming together in the same way. One possibility that they could have utilized was to put the missing father of the character Han Soo Yeon more at the center of the story to act like a similar plot device to the baby in season 1. Another way in which the story lacks continuity is through characters coming in and out of the story so frequently even when they should realistically be present more often. One such character is the landlord of the guesthouse who just disappears after the first few episodes. The guesthouse is also quite inconsistent since at times it feels like an actual guesthouse where there are actual guests living while at other times it just feels like our main casts dorm or collective living where they lounge about however they please without anyone else coming in or out.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,5 / 10* \- It is a perfect pick-me-up drama to watch whenever you are feeling like watching something fun but don’t go in expecting a mind blowing story. The comedy mostly hits the mark and it is occasionally quite touching. My single biggest wish would be that the story was more coherent, which would significantly improve the quality of the story writing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He Is Psychometric - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sci-fi crime drama with elements of comedy and romance about a young man with the power to see past events just by touching objects or people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) I really enjoy the recurring metaphor of a bird being tied down by chains inside of a cage and the notion that even if we want to leave we can’t as we are all tied down to something. In the case of the characters in this show, they are all tied down to the events of the past. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;Seong Mo and his mother are still affected by the physical chains and abuse Seong Mo’s father put them through. Seong Mo’s father in return is still tied to the enslavement he experienced in his childhood. Ahn and Jae In had their lives altered by the apartment complex fire and to this day it is something that they can’t let go off. Ji Soo and her father are still tied to the father’s corrupt dealings in the past which restrict them.&lt;/span&gt; There are other nice metaphors as well such as the trap, sail and anchor metaphor, but the bird in the cage was the one that really stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Although the main actors are young, they put in a good performance. Shin Yeeun, playing the role of the smart girl Yoon Jae In looking to fight crime, is actually a really good rookie actress. I’ve previously seen her in her breakout role in the hit webdrama “A-teen” (2018) where she was quite noticeably the brightest star. I was curious as to how she would transition into a full scale TV production and I think she managed just fine. Playing opposite her is Park Jinyoung who plays Lee Ahn, a boy with psychometric powers that allow him to see past events just by touching objects or people. This is Park Jinyoung’s second main role in a TV production, after having many support roles earlier on. Both of the main leads have big roles to play that are not easy by any stretch of the imagination. Jinyoung needs to play a playful goofball without overplaying and also display a ton of depth and trauma. Meanwhile, Yeeun needs to play a withdrawn and calculative police officer while not coming of as plain at the same time as she needs to display both sadness and a lust for revenge. Overall, I think they both managed this quite well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The fight scenes are few and far between but when they decide to throw one in it is well executed. There is one fight scene in particular that takes place in a narrow corridor that is really  nicely choreographed and well shot with two of the main leads fighting a bunch of henchmen. Obviously, it is not as sick as other iconic corridor fight scenes like in “Old Boy” (2003) or Netflix’s “Daredevil” (2015) but it is fairly well done and a quite memorable scene from the drama. The main difference maker is that those were both shot in one extended take whereas this is is more fine tuned and polished with many different shots, which takes away from the rawness of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The establishment of characters and exposition is really smooth. It definitely uses “show don’t tell” in a textbook way. It tells us through the set design what the conflict in the Yeongsang apartment complex revolves around. Through the cinematography, it becomes clear to us that Ahn and Seong Mo have become brothers. We don’t need to see the whole process of them deciding to live together. Instead, that scene is shown to us later when it has more of an emotional impact. I also enjoy how  Ahn’s powers are established to be very underdeveloped to begin with due to him avoiding physical contact as much as he can. He doesn’t start out being this really powerful protagonist, instead we get to follow him on his hero’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The show uses color grading to great effect. In case you didn’t know, color grading video is a digital technique that is done after filming and changes the color tone and mood of the film and was pioneered by the Oscar winner ”Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?” in the year 2000. In “He is Psychometric”’s flashback scenes, color grading is used to give everything a sort of yellow tint which gives of a nostalgic feeling, indicating visually that what you are watching took place in the past. In certain scenes, the color grading is really amped up to nine, only focusing on highlight a certain color or a certain object while leaving the rest of the shot monochromatic. Impactful imagery such as blood, fire or light is usually what is highlighted during these sequences of extreme color grading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The show uses dolly shots to creative effect. A dolly shot is executed by zooming in or out with the camera while moving the camera forwards or backwards on a track. The result is that the foreground stays in the same position while the background appears to squeeze or stretch. Usually this is done in relation to Ahn’s psychometry which gives us a sense that he is focused on what he is doing but at the same time emphasising to us how dizzy his powers make him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The genre mix between romcom and crime thriller requires the viewer to enjoy both genres and how the drama executes them. Fortunately for me, I do enjoy both genres and think the drama executed both genres pretty well. I appreciate that they didn’t jump back and forth a whole lot between being comedic and dark instead there was a proper transition from leaning in a more light hearted direction to a more serious direction. However, I see why the genre mix would be off putting to viewers who just want to see a romcom or just want to see a crime drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The twist is not surprising at all. Pretty early on, it becomes clear that there are only two people that would have motive to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;fake the death of Prosecutor Seong Mo’s mom: Seong Mo and the mom. Once we learn about just how frail of a mental state the mother is in, it’s confirmed that the prosecutor was the one to fake his mother’s death by killing the women’s group and starting the apartment complex fire. From early on, it is also quite apparent from the editing where the camera lingers on Seong Mo then and cuts to menacing imagery that he is either a red herring or guilty in some way. The only question that remains afterwards is how involved he is in the murders and fires.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some writing decisions felt like they were done purely to get a reaction out of the audience. For instance, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;killing off Kim Da Som’s character, detective Eun Ji Soo, has little effect on the story. It doesn’t establish how violent the main antagonist is since we already know he is ruthless. The only thing that it really has an effect on is Ji Soo’s father deciding to out the corrupt actions of himself and the construction company.&lt;/span&gt; Comparatively, there are other kdramas that have managed to &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;kill off main characters&lt;/span&gt; to great effect where one &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;character’s death&lt;/span&gt; has a massive impact on multiple facets of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - I enjoyed many aspects of the drama and with stronger writing it could have been a nine or higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Prisoner - KBS2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical thriller drama about a doctor out to get revenge on those who made him lose his medical license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The lighting in this drama in a bunch of scenes is 0% realism and 100% aesthetic, and I dig the hell out of that. Some scenes are just pure darkness that is drenched in yellow light and it looks so sick. Whether it be inside the prison or an interrogation room in the prosecutor&amp;#39;s office, the heavily stylized lighting and color palette is featured which makes the drama stand out visually and really stick with you in your mind. It becomes a signature of the drama, through which you know they did a good job creating a unique art direction when it becomes so iconic and synonymous with the drama itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The cast is ridiculously stacked with great actors and actresses. Have you ever wondered what would happen if you just picked out some of the actors from stellar dramas like Signal, Stranger, SKY Castle and the likes, then put them in the same drama. You get a show that is as well acted as Doctor Prisoner. The three men at the forefront, Nam Goong Min as the vindictive Dr. Na Yi Je, Choi Won Young as the power hungry CEO Lee Jae Joon and Kim Byung Chul as prison director Seon Min Sik, all put up ridiculously good performances. The ladies in the spotlight were no joke either, as Jin Hee Kyung, Lee Da In and even Nara, considering her lack of acting experience, did very well for themselves in their respective scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The plot is absolutely bonkers in the best way possible. There are about three plot twist per episode as the different characters try to mess with one another to outsmart or one up each other. There are not any established teams but instead the characters switch their allegiances when it suits their personal interest which I found both realistic and fascinating. In many cases, you are not quite sure whether you can fully trust a character, which is a good thing as it adds to the suspense. None of the characters are purely good or purely evil and there is always a reason behind why a character acts a certain way, which means that while you may hate a character because of their vile actions, you come to understand their motivations. While the different characters’ motivations are never muddled, they are not obvious to the point that the plot becomes predictable. The only thing you can really predict with one hundred percent accuracy is that the plot will remain unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) It breaks the mold of the genre. I can confidently state that I usually don’t like medical dramas. However, I loved Doctor Prisoner since it strays away from the usual way a medical drama plays out. Firstly, the setting is not just a regular hospital as it takes place in a prison. Resources are scarce and the doctors have to make due with what they got in order to save their patients instead of relying on top-notch equipment. Since it takes place in a prison, there are also additional dangers as the patients and the people around them can be quite cumbersome. Just like the prisoners, the doctors also play by prison rules and occasionally throw ethics out of the window to further their own interest. Secondly, the conflict is seldom just “this patient has X symptoms, we have to solve it”, there are always additional layers behind how the patient came to be ill and why they absolutely need to be saved despite being criminals. There is always a main overarching conflict in the power struggle to hold power over a prison or a hospital or a company. Lastly, they managed to make a medical drama into more of a thriller instead of focusing largely on romance or melodrama like many medical dramas do, which is why I found it easier to digest and more unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Some of the cast is underutilized, especially Nara’s character Han So Geum. A lot of the show’s focus is on the power struggle between the three gentlemen Na Yi Je, Lee Jae Joon and Seon Min Sik all looking to one up each other. As a result, even though Nara has a main role on the billing credits, she is pushed to the side quite a lot. Perhaps it is because she doesn’t quite have the same experience and resume that the other main actors have, in any case, she feels more like a supporting character. If one were to look at the drama from a gender perspective, it is a very male centered drama, which is unfortunate but fairly accurate considering the balance of genders in director and CEO positions in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The same thing applies to the comedy in this drama like what I wrote about the comedy in Kingdom. I personally don’t mind it, but I understand that if you are looking for a dark drama purely free from comedy, then the occasional comic relief would be a drawback. I felt like they went about the comedy bits in a tasteful way though and in my opinion, they added to the show more than they took away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The soundtrack isn’t all that. There is one main score that is played throughout the drama which is alright in itself but it becomes a bit repetitive. In suspenseful scenes, they always blast the sound of a heart rate monitor beeping loudly instead of an actual OST. The beeping ends up feeling overused towards the back half of the series as they use it at least once per episode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) For once, I didn’t feel like the drama was too long but instead too short. The series was supposed to be extended for 2 episodes but ended up being reduced back to 32 episodes, which resulted in some questions being left unanswered by the plot. However, with the immense popularity of the drama in South Korea, a possible sequel is on the table, &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;especially considering the way the drama ended.&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps some of the loose threads will be tied up then, but for now we are left wondering what happened to certain characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 9,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The drama has enough small flaws not to warrant it a perfect score of ten out of ten, but it does come very close and it is surely a stand out drama of the year that you are doing yourself a disservice by not watching if you like a thrilling and tightly written story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confession - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal crime drama about a lawyer seeking the truth behind a murder that resulted in his father ending up on death row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Large thanks to &lt;a href=""/r/KDRAMA""&gt;r/KDRAMA&lt;/a&gt; ’s very own &lt;a href=""/u/ordinaryguy92""&gt;u/ordinaryguy92&lt;/a&gt; for ripping and syncing the sub as this drama was never officially licensed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama includes some really good courtroom scenes with solid logic behind the reasoning of the defense and the prosecution. Some of the social commentary is pretty solid as well, such as how corrupt people in power use celebrity scandals to control the media and distract the public from their own dirty deeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The direction is on point. I wouldn’t expect any less coming from the director of Mother and Chicago Typewriter. Although the camera work is very intense with a lot of movement it manages it very well. Most of the time, the camera is slightly moving and zooming, creating urgency, fluidity and focus on whatever is currently important in the frame. Despite moving the camera a lot, there is rarely shaky cam (except for a few cases) or problems with blurry zooms or the focus being off. The camera movement is just really buttery which results in a very pleasant viewing experience. The drama also manages to use lens flare in a tasteful way that is not over the top with how in your face lens flare can be used for artistic effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The writer Im Hee Cheol is pretty new to the scene but did an excellent job, proving that although experience is important, it is not everything. The story takes some twist and turns and it is not always obvious what is going to happen although yet the story progresses very naturally. It should be said though that some plot points are very obviously foreshadowed so if you are well versed in film and literature they should come as no surprise to you. One example of this is &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the fact that Choi ’s father took the blame for killing the warrant officer in order to get his son a heart transplant which ended up with father being murdered. This is quite apparent already in episode 5 but they make it a big reveal of it in episode 11 and confirm it in episode 14. As a viewer you’re just left like: ”yes, we been knew for a while now”.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some great fake outs in this drama where something is introduced and thanks to the editing you think it will benefit or damage the protagonist but it turns out to do the opposite, resulting in some great reversals of expectations. One such occurrence is when it seems like a device is recording the protagonists conversation and it will end up hurting them but as it turns out that device was actually planted there by someone with the same goal as our heroes and it turns out the device contains important evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Lee Junho is pretty good at acting, the stereotype of ”idol actor” definitely does not apply to him. Although his character is quite reserved in this drama, he manages to avoid falling in to the trap of appearing to be wooden. You can tell on his face that there are plenty of emotions flowing within the character despite the calm and collected facade that would indicate otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama requires some suspension of disbelief. Some of the time aspects seem a bit off in order to make the story more interesting. A person of interest always arrive in court at the very last second and investigations are started late in order for them to finish right before the trial. Additionally as with all crime series, you have police officers, prosecutor and even crime scene investigators not wearing proper equipment for examining a crime scene and touching things in a crime scene with their bare hands. Once again, it ruins the immersion but it is something that you can look past once you suspend your disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Although the camera movement is mostly really smooth, I wish they would have used more fixed shots for some scenes where constantly moving the camera adds little to nothing to the scene. It’s fine if you’re not actively thinking about it, but once you start analyzing the series shot by shot, it becomes slightly annoying. Additionally, the handheld shaky cam used in for instance chase scenes is such a stark contrast to the otherwise really smooth camera work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The sound mixing is a little uneven at points which makes it clear that some of the dubbed dialogue was recorded at different occasions as the sound level and quality varies between takes. For the uninitiated, the reason for dubbing over a scene while still using the original actors voice could be that the scene is recorded in a location that does not allow for good quality audio recordings due to for instance echo or strong wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) I’m not a big fan of the dramatic “sting” sound effect that they add whenever they need to up up the tension. It has become dime a dozen in almost every movie trailer these days but the usage of it especially in the actually series feels rather lazy and uninspired. The drama is exciting enough as it is, it doesn’t need this stinger sound whenever something important is revealed. Sure, these types of sound effects where fresh when used in movies that popularized them such as Transformers (2006) and Inception (2010), but around ten years later they’ve grown stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - I really enjoy the story but some of the production choices and misses really hinders my score from being any higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill It - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action thriller drama about a professional assassin trying to find out about his mysterious past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The actors were well cast for their roles. Nana does a good job at portraying detective Do Hyun Jin despite not having many dramas on her resume previously. Jang Ki Yong is perfect for the role of an emotionless assassin such as the character of Kim Soo Hyun he plays here. Noh Jung Eui is great as the orphan Kang Seulgi considering she is only 17 years old, much thanks to her already extensive list of dramas that she has acted in during the last 8 years. Lee Jae Won is also a great fit as the mischievous hacker Phillip Ahn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The actors also had some pretty good chemistry with each other. Even though there is no romance in this drama, the tension between Hyun Jin and Soo Hyun is palpable and it feels like you can cut the atmosphere with a knife. Soo Hyun and Seulgi have a interesting relationship much like that of an older brother and a younger sister despite not being related. They take care of each other in different ways and bicker with one another just like siblings do. Hyun Jin and Seulgi have a somewhat love-hate relationship to one another as they start out as enemies but after a while they grow on each other. Soo Hyun and Phillip have some bromance and banter amongst each other in one scene and are at each others neck in the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) “Kill It” has parallels to one of my favorite novels of the 21st century, in that one of the themes and plot line is quite similar. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;The novel in question is “Never Let Me Go” (2005) from the Nobel prize winning author Kazuo Ishiguro. “Never Let Me Go” touches upon the use of cloning humans in order to harvest their organs. Although “Kill It” doesn’t have any cloning but it does focus on the ethics of using test tube children for the same purpose. Much like in “Never Let Me Go”, the children that are to be harvested for their organs are kept in an institution far away from the rest of civilization. Both of the stories deals with organ harvesting, medical ethics and research ethics and asks questions about the human condition like what is the worth of a human being and whether some people have an inherently higher worth than others.&lt;/span&gt; I really enjoy this aspect of the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The art direction and color palette of the drama is a huge let down. You know that really cool color palette of black, neon blue and neon pink that was on the poster for the show? Yea, that shows up in exactly one scene. A lot of the drama is just slathered in grey and brown going for the most generic art direction for a serious crime thriller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Probably the biggest issue is the writing of the show.  This is probably due to the screenwriters Choi Myung Jin and Son Hyun Soo being brand new to writing a drama, so one can understand why the series has its writing flaws as new writers usually need time to get really good.  Up until around the halfway mark of the story it isn’t too bad. However, after that is were it really starts to come apart in the seams. After half of the drama has passed too much information has already been relayed and the audience has already had almost everything revealed to them. They unraveled the plot in 6 episodes and after that we are left just watching the characters learn what we’ve already been clued in on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Characters are introduced to have traits that are never used for anything useful. Hyun Jin is shown to be excellent at throwing darts but never uses this skill for anything other than shutting up snarky colleagues. The characters are not strongly enough written to have many different facets to them and many of the characters outside of the main cast are very one-dimensional. As a result the characters do not drive the drama forward either when the plot is stalling. None of the characters go through major character development but stay rather static during the drama, with Seulgi being the only character to grow noticeably in the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The alternative title for this show is Blue Eyes, indicating that they are an important part to the story. Throughout the first episode, the editing also puts a lot of emphasis on the blue eyes, making the viewer think it will lead to something integral to the story. The only real tie-in to it during the rest of the show is that we briefly learn that the blue eyes are a &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;side effect of the artificial insemination and the test tube babies being developed in a lab.&lt;/span&gt; This leaves us with the pressing question of what happened to Soo Hyun’s blue eyes, as he had them when he was around 10 and he doesn’t have them at adult age. This is never answered in the show despite putting a lot of focus on the blue eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The dialogue is a bit lacking and it has the typical kdrama issue of having many interactions being expressed purely through stares. It’s not quite at “Twilight” (2008) level of staring but there is still too much staring and too little dialogue for my liking. Especially since some of the dialogue is pretty decent, primarily the banter between the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 5,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The concept was really cool, the casting was good and it touches on some interesting topics but the weak writing in regards to the plot and the characters in combination with a mostly uninspired art direction makes for a slightly below average drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eulachacha Waikiki 2 - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sitcom drama about a group of friends living at a guest house who keep finding themselves caught up in wacky scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) It is quite unique in the sense that it is one of the only prime time sitcoms to air in the last couple of years. Yes, there are other comedy shows but very few use the sitcom format, which makes it stand out of the crowd in the kdrama landscape. As it is a sitcom, much of the comedy comes from the situations that the characters find themselves in. Many situations are also created by the characters through their lying and how the lying just keeps escalating is executed really well. Instead of causing frustrating misunderstandings it leads to ridiculously funny scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) They use really cheesy effects in a good way, making them intentionally funny. For instance they use the classic comic book effect of a spark in the sky to indicate a home run. This shot isn’t meant to look good or realistic, it’s meant to be funny and it manages that well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) They use contrastive humor really well. For instance when there is chaos in a scene and they make it into a montage and put cheery music over it. What adds to the hilariousness is that the main cast are all really good at body gags. Through just their facial expressions and bodies they convey comedy that is truly universal and crosses language barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The show integrates aspects that are staples of Korean variety shows. It is not the first drama to do this but it never fails to be funny. Examples includes such classics as blasting Careless Whisper by George Michael when something is implied to be erotic, or Mai Piu by Andrea Bocelli when someone is expecting something romantic, or She Is by Clazziquai Project when there is some implied guy-on-guy action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) The referential humor is on point, when they referenced The Face Reader, I was rolling with laughter. Game of Thrones soundtrack when determining who will take the throne of being the most handsome. Something in the Rain soundtrack plays everytime there is hints of noona romance, that actually isn’t that romantic. There are so many other references in the drama as well, some of which include: Harry Potter, The Guest, SKY Castle, Suicide Squad, Forrest Gump, The X-Files, Kill Bill, Love Actually, and Kimi No Nawa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The show also manages to deliver some really heartfelt and touching moments in between all the silly wackiness. All of the main cast get to show of their weaknesses, their dreams and their aspirations which makes the viewer really connect with them. It gives the show a lot of heart and makes the joke really count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This show is riddled with plot holes and the story is definitely something that comes second whereas the comedy comes first. The natural progression of a story is thrown out of the window for the sake of comedy. While there is nothing inherently wrong with that, it would be more impressive if they could balance the two aspects at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The comedy by repetition can be pretty funny, but at the same time it can also get really stale when they just spend too much time repeating the same joke over and over again. If you find the joke funny to begin with, it’s probably gonna get even funnier, but if you didn’t enjoy it, you’ll wish they just stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) That one suicide joke in episode 14 just didn’t sit right with me. It felt so unnecessary. Considering the very high youth suicide rates in South Korea, I just cannot fathom why the writers would think this was a good idea. There is nothing wrong with dark comedy but when it comes out of left field in an otherwise lighthearted series it just feels out of place and unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Due to its sitcom nature, the story lacks continuity. Unlike in season 1 where there is the baby left at the Waikiki guesthouse acting as an overarching plot thread that ties everything together, there is a lack of such a thing in season 2. That results in the story line not coming together in the same way. One possibility that they could have utilized was to put the missing father of the character Han Soo Yeon more at the center of the story to act like a similar plot device to the baby in season 1. Another way in which the story lacks continuity is through characters coming in and out of the story so frequently even when they should realistically be present more often. One such character is the landlord of the guesthouse who just disappears after the first few episodes. The guesthouse is also quite inconsistent since at times it feels like an actual guesthouse where there are actual guests living while at other times it just feels like our main casts dorm or collective living where they lounge about however they please without anyone else coming in or out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is a perfect pick-me-up drama to watch whenever you are feeling like watching something fun but don’t go in expecting a mind blowing story. The comedy mostly hits the mark and it is occasionally quite touching. My single biggest wish would be that the story was more coherent, which would significantly improve the quality of the story writing.&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post).

We have some really fun questions about drama watching habits, drama preferences, language, travel, etc. There is a stickied post at the top of the subreddit with the link. Don&amp;#39;t be shy! Participate! Be counted! Results will be available in a separate post in a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, thank you all for making this community work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love is the moment,&lt;/p&gt;

Han Gyul (acted by the awesome Gong Yoo) and Eun Chan (acted by Yoon Eun Hye) in 'Coffee Prince'.
Well, their chemistry was on fire🔥❤️ Han Gyul and Eun Chan looked so natural together and their kisses are still to this date one of the best/ most passionate in dramaland!! 💋 Gotta enjoy their friendship and""bromance"", how Han Gyul and Eun Chan made a pact to be ""brothers"" (before Han Gyul found out about Eun Chan's true gender) ... I enjoyed their relationship with each other as friends, and also as lovers. No awkwardess or anything between them , all felt gennuine and real. And I doubt anyone could forget about Han Gyul's confession of love towards Eun Chan , one of the most memorable confessions in dramaland~ 

Se Ryung (acted by Moon Chae Won) and Seung Yoo (acted by Park Shi Hoo) in 'The Princess' Man'.
This is often called the Joseon version of Romeo and Juliet. A deep, intense love between the OTP. The OTP started out as carefree, cute and sweet without any worries in the world... but that later turned everything upside down when Seung Yoo finds out that his love's father is the person he hates more than anything. Everything gets angsty, tragic , complicated and full of heartache... I don't wanna spoil too much for those who haven't seen it but the chemistry between MCW and PSH is amazing...  One can totally feel the love and yearning those two lovers holds for each other. Also, I totally get why this is called The Princess' man, because Se Ryung is so loyal to her man, fights for him and risks her life for him many times etc. She is also so admirable 'cuz she is so strong willed! 

Boong Do (acted by Ji Hyun Woo) and Hee Jin (acted by Yoo In Na) in 'Queen In Hyun's Man'. 
Wow, just wow... their chemistry is to die for and it's no wonder really 'cuz JHW and YIA had a thing for each other during the filming and even dated each other for a while afterwards! Their kisses are so swoon worthy and all their scenes together so natural. I love how they were so caring and trusting of each other from the start... and that Boong Do is such good looking gentleman and Hee Jin so freakin' adorableee~ Theyre so supportive of each other and respects the other one so well, one can really tell how much in love they are. It's truly a sweet time travel romance that every hopeless romantic at heart should watch!! Their relationship is GOALS in my opinion. It's just a delight to watch those two being all lovely dovey together, not much angst between them... the only thing that's a hindrance to their relationship is that they're both from different time...

&lt;p&gt;[edit] thanks all for the responses so far! they&amp;#39;ve also helped me to better understand the question i&amp;#39;d wanted to ask - which is liking &lt;strong&gt;an actor/actress vs liking an actor/actress&amp;#39; performance/portrayal of characters&lt;/strong&gt;. :) [/edit]&lt;/p&gt;

**WEEKLY BINGE OVERVIEW**

Anyone is welcome to join the Weekly Binge.

Every week we host two discussions (Thursday/Sunday) in which we discuss  approximately three hours/three episodes of a selected drama, in total approximately 6 hours/episodes per week. We are all from different time zones so there is no need to panic about being late to the party (we do operate on KST as a standard).

Within the frame of the episodes being discussed you may discuss anything you can think of. Whether it is a one-off post to say you love Lee Dong Hwi/Go Ah Sung and wish they were in more dramas, rant about the worst boss you ever had, essays about something that took you 101 attempts to get right, screenshots of the perfection that is Ha Suk Jin, episodic notes, a letter of resignation you never handed in, a haiku about how revitalising energy supplements are, the choice is  yours.

If you have previously completed the drama, or, got ahead on the binge please be courteous of those who are watching the drama for the first time. When in doubt [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags) are your friend.

When we get close to the end of a drama we open up nominations (third last post) for a new drama, those dramas are then short listed by regular members of the Weekly Binge before we open up voting to members of[ r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) (second last post). Every time we have a new restriction for the type of drama, so that we will not repeat the same type of drama over and over, and so that the Binge will be attractive for different people with  different tastes.

Please only vote on  drama selection if you plan on joining in watching and discussing the chosen drama with us. Yes, you may love said drama and want us to watch, but,there are other ways to express that love, i.e. posting a review  to [r/KDRAMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA) that will convince others to watch it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Weekly Binge discussion of &lt;a href=""https://mydramalist.com/22236-radiant-office""&gt;Radiant Office&lt;/a&gt; episodes 6 - 8.

**Introduction:**

The next part of the review series is here! To start of with, I’d like to thank everyone for the love and support that Part 1 got which has motivated me to keep writing. I wouldn’t be doing these posts if not for this lovely community. For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.

Before I get started with Part 2, I would like to say a few things. Compared to January, I don’t think the dramas that were released in February were as strong. As a result there are quite a few negative and lukewarm reviews in this post. I know I am not going to make myself popular by putting these opinions out there but I feel it would be disingenuous to say I think a drama is better than what I actually think just to have a more favorable reception. As usual, I will argue why I have said opinions of a certain show and I encourage you lovely people to argue against me if you think my stance or score is unfair. Just to make it clear, I don’t rate shows averagely because I hate kdramas. It’s rather the opposite, I love kdramas, otherwise I wouldn’t be putting so much effort into these posts. Since I love kdramas, I want to shine light on what I think is really good, and if I were to give everything a great score then that would devalue what I think are the actually great shows. I will be returning to form with more positive reviews for the March post, I promise.

With that being said, let’s get started!

&amp;#x200B;

**February**

&amp;#x200B;

**Touch Your Heart - TvN**

Romcom drama about an attorney and a movie star who find unexpected love when opposites attract.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good*

(1) The hype surrounding these two main leads coming together once again was immense, but even though expectations were sky high, I think they both lived up to the hype. Yes, obviously their characters are different from their previous drama Goblin, since this is a different series, yet the characters and the actors’ performances are great in their own right.

Yoo In Na’s portrayal of Oh Yun Seo is great. This is not her first time portraying an actress on screen and there have been many comparisons between Oh Yun Seo and her roles in Queen In Hyun’s Man and My Love From The Stars as well as fellow actress Jun Ji Hyun’s character from said drama. Yet, the presentation of Oh Yun Seo feels distinctly different and charming on its own. Even though she is childish, airheaded and naive, the audience quickly comes to root for Yun Seo as she is genuine, cute and very human. Lee Dong Wook as the lawyer Kwon Jung Rok is no slouch either as he put up a really good performance. At first he comes off as cold and unfriendly but we soon learn that he is upstanding, caring and sweet. Both of the actors manage to display great duality in their characters showing us that there are many sides to a person and that first impressions aren’t everything.

The contrast between the two main lead characters are shown throughout the different aspects of the drama, even down to the set design. Oh Yun Seo’s apartment and desk is bright, cute, fluffy and playful. Kwon Jung Rok’s apartment and desk is traditional, serious, toned down and functional. It truly feels like these characters work and live in these spaces and have made them their own.

(2) Despite how enjoyable both the leads are to watch, the best acting performance of the drama definitely belongs to Kim Dae Gon who plays a butcher’s son with a mental disability and does so in a convincing fashion. He really sells it with his portrayal of a naive and neurotic man who ends up in a lot of trouble regardless of his good intentions. Along with him and many others, the supporting cast are for the most part quite charismatic and memorable. Each character has their own quirks and add either humor or weight to the drama.

(3) I really like the camera movement of this drama and also the times at which they chose to incorporate camera movement. The camera movement is smooth in the use of zooms, pans, tilts, trucking, dollies and pedestals. Better yet, the movement rarely feels overused or like it’s something that was thrown in just for visual interest. Sometimes, just having a stationary shot creates a more pleasant viewing and allows the actor to really pierce through the screen, which creates more emotion.

(4) Besides just the camera movement, many other aspects of how the drama was shot is also really well done. I really like how a lot of interactions between our main leads are filmed. Instead of just relying on over-shoulder-shots for much of their conversations, the director often uses two-shots of them in either a full shot size or ¾ shot size. At the beginning it emphasises on how standoffish their relationship is whereas later on it emphasises their romantic chemistry.

Another really creative thing that the director does in the drama is to use character positions as visual indicators. This allows for group conversations to be filmed without constantly establishing the speaker with a close up, instead it becomes apparent who is speaking through who is leaning forward or somehow has a position that sets them aside from non-speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad*

(1) The drama falls into a lot of clichés and is often predictable. You know what you are going to get and that is both a strength and a weakness. Some people might find this drama to be überfluff and just way too sweet and cutesy, but fortunately for me, I have a sweet tooth. It is directed by the same person who directed “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim”, which shares the same fluffy feel-good romcom formula. I believe that formula is quite polarizing and will draw some viewers in while pushing other viewers out. The premise is not something very unique either considering it is one of the many office romance dramas to air this year where the man is the boss and the woman is his subordinate.

(2) Sometimes the characters act out of character just to create tension and drama. The most noticeable instance of this happening is &gt;!during episode 13 when the drama decides to incorporate the frustrating noble idiocy trope. Characters who once had great trust and communication suddenly stop talking and decide to be angsty by themselves, leading to great frustration for the viewer and inconsistent characterization.!&lt;

(3) Some of the subplots are just not that well thought out or executed. As it mostly takes place at Always Law Firm, this drama does have several legal plots and although I’m not an attorney, I can say that the courtroom scenes are not very believable and sometimes lack proper logic or courtroom etiquette. To be fair, this is expected from pretty much all kdramas that are not specifically legal dramas though, but the execution could absolutely have been better. There are two ways that it could have been solved, either invest time into better research and writing for these scenes or go more over-the-top with them to make them humorous and not to be taken seriously. Furthermore, there are subplots that go nowhere and are not very well structured such as the whole plot line about the creepy stalker of Oh Yun Seo.

Since my proficiency in Korean is only of the level that my regular intake of writing mostly consists of webcomics and children’s books, I haven’t read the web novel “Jinsimi Dadda” from which the story is adapted. Thus, I do not know if the flaws in the show’s writing comes from the screenwriter or just as a product of making a faithful adaptation. Therefore, I will not comment on that matter.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 8,0 / 10* \- It is not a very deep or original drama, but it doesn’t try to be that either. It executes what it’s going for pretty well and I think the great acting, set design and camera work justifies the score.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Trap - OCN**

Crime thriller drama about a family man who ends up involved with a group of people who enjoy hunting humans.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The plot is really gritty and has a lot of twists and turns. No character feels like they are safe and it truly feels like anything can happen. Important characters get killed or have their lives ruined without warning. It’s one of those dramas that grabs your full attention with its thriller elements. The thriller elements in combination with the series only having 7 episodes makes for a perfect series to binge-watch it in one sitting. The drama doesn’t have room to drag or get boring. As a result of only having 7 episodes, it feels pretty tightly written. Not once throughout the show’s runtime did I feel myself getting disinterested in the story. Despite being very thrilling, Trap doesn’t fall into the Michael Bay category of just being high octane constantly which ultimately feels flat. Trap had its quiet moments too which allows it to build up to the climactic scenes and the suspense become more tangible than in a series that just puts the pedal the metal and never lets go.

(2) Sung Dong Il is a really good actor as always. In Trap, he plays detective Go Dong Kook who is close to retiring but decides to take on one last case. Sung Dong Il has almost 30 years of acting experience and you can really tell. Due to his age he rarely gets main roles in Kdramas nowadays and is often cast as a side character. Therefore, it is really refreshing to see him get so much spotlight in the role of a main character next to Lee Seo Jin who plays Kang Woo Hyun.

(3) In the context of a kdrama, the story and premise is quite unique. There is some good usage of metaphors with the whole hunting and trap motif that runs throughout the story. The metaphor is referred to in the background even, such as when Go Dong Kook is in the museum and the guide is talking about how humans evolved to invent tools that allowed us to become hunters. This acts as foreshadowing to the twisted hunting group that think they have evolved further than the rest of humanity and they use this logic to justify their hunting of other humans.

(4) The cinematography is mostly really good. They do a good job with keeping the eyelines lined up correctly even in scenes that are more complex. They use some pretty cool drone shots sweeping over the landscape showing of the setting and having the added bonus of looking really gorgeous as the scenery is filled with autumn forests and winding country roads. Some crane shots are also used in the show in order to extend shots that would otherwise have required multiple cuts, which creates great momentum and fluidity. Even some of the handheld camera movement is surprisingly solid in the sense that it doesn’t involve too much shaky cam and it tracks the character movement well keeping them in frame but with enough space to allow for you to see actions that happens around them.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama tries to execute a really difficult way of storytelling and it doesn’t work out very well as the execution of said technique is just so hard. &gt;!In my opinion, executing a plot twist which involves an unreliable narrator is so hard to get right in cinematic form, as opposed to in a novel. The reason for this is because in a drama or a movie, the filmmakers have to show us shots that the unreliable narrator possibly couldn't have known about or been apart of, such as other characters actions and dialogue or establishing shots when the narrator is not on screen. This makes the viewer feel cheated since the producers show us additional lies that the narrator is not telling us. I just felt like the series crumbled when they couldn't execute this properly, which I don't blame them for since it is very difficult to do. One sign of a plot twist being really good is that it adds to the rewatch value of the show, but with the plot twist of this show you don’t get the satisfaction of seeing the puzzle come together upon a rewatch as the twist is just ”I lied”. The ”I lied” twist can be used in an interesting way such as seen in Primal Fear (1996), but one main error that Trap commits is that it explicitly explains all of its misdirections to us rather than letting the audience discover these for themselves either by thinking back on the show or upon a rewatch.!&lt;

(2) I also felt like the filmmakers tried to be dark for the sake of being dark rather than for plot reasons, which comes of as a bit pretentious and overly edgy to me. But hey, to each their own, we all have different standards for what comes off as trying to hard. One of the most important aspects when writing a dark story is to write morally grey characters that have proper motivations for doing bad things so that the viewers can understand the characters actions. A prototypical example of this would be Walter White from Breaking Bad (2008) who turns to selling meth but has understandable motivations for doing so since he has cancer and needs to take care of his family. Among Korean series, Stranger (2017) would be a great example of an ensemble of well written morally ambiguous characters with proper motivations. The motivations of killing and doing bad deeds in Trap mostly just stop at ”I do it because I’m a psychopath”, which applies to the majority of the cast, except for the two main characters &gt;!who are looking for revenge even though Kang Woo Hyun does it because he is a psychopath as well.!&lt;

(3) The way they tried to wrap up the ending was quite disappointing. There are way too many plot threads left hanging. I don’t mind setting up for a sequel if that is what they are going for, but that should be done with some tact. Make sure to finish the current arc and then you can throw out a bit of teaser in the vane of ”it’s not over yet”. In this drama they just abandoned the first main arc of the story about 90% done and then called it a day. There are no signs of a season 2 ever happening either which results in a pretty unsatisfying situation as the viewer doesn’t get any closure.

(4) There are some really crappy visual effects in this drama. For instance, the fire in the opening scene is painful to look at. The flames are so obviously added in digitally through post production as you can tell they are on a different layer than the physical scene, there is some artifacting on the flames, the movement of the flames is predictable since they are animated and there is little to no smoke added in digitally to boot.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,0 / 10* \- The concept for this drama is excellent and it’s accompanied by good actors and cinematography but the poor effects and especially the writing hiccups impacted the drama quite negatively.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Light in Your Eyes - JTBC**

Melodrama with elements of romance and comedy about a woman who has the ability to turn back time but at the price of growing old. The drama showcases the joys and hardships of growing old.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The choreography is really strong throughout the drama. They have probably the nicest shots of scenery and nature out of all the dramas of the year so far. From the lonely bus stop at night which we’ve all cried at once or twice in our lives, to the waves crashing in on the sandy beach while seagulls flock above, this drama is filled with eye candy that really fits each scene.

They also use plenty of creative camera angles. I am weak for angles in which they film from within different confined space which then frames the character on the outside of the confined space. Thus, one of my favorite shots happen early on when the mischievous Young Soo reaches in under the sink after a portable grill and he almost touches the camera as the scene is being filmed from under the sink. It’s just such a cool and creative camera angle.

(2) The ending of episode 10. It’s impossible to talk about this drama without talking about this part of the show. If you haven’t watched the show and don’t want to get spoiled, just skip to the next talking point, just know that this episode is one of the most impactful episodes of this year. &gt;!This plot twist changes everything about the drama and explains a lot of the intentionally written plot points that do not make sense. The chronology and the lack of realism is all explained by Hye Ja actually being a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. The twist is the key that unlocks the drama and allows you to fully understand all the confusing moments that were brought about earlier in the drama. This type of a twist where the events of the plots are all part of an imaginary world was popularized by the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1890) by Ambrose Bierce. As the story gets more incoherent and more and more unlikely events take place, the reader/viewer starts to realize that something fishy is going on. What is really going on behind the scenes is masked by memories that are all distorted and mixed up until the final reveal when it becomes clear that the rest of the story is just the memories of a person at the end of their lives.!&lt;

&gt;!This type of a twist operates very similarly to the ”it was all a dream” type twists in that much of the film took part outside of the ”real world”. This sort of a twist can be quite controversial as when it’s executed poorly it leaves the viewer with a sense that they wasted their time. However, it can be used to great effect, which I think is the case for The Light in Your Eyes. As far as cinema goes probably the best example of a well executed ”it was all a dream” twists can be found in the classic movie ”The Wizard of Oz” (1939), paving the way by showing that this twist can be used to achieve other purposes other than as an easy out for writers who have written themselves into a corner. In both stories, the dream experiences are used to cope with their respective main characters’ problems. As for Hye Ja, she gets to experience an existence wherein she saves her son (or father in the dream) from an accident that crippled him, which is a sort of trigger for her as indicated by that incident being what made her imagine herself as her real age even in her visions.!&lt;

(3) I really enjoy the setting and all the set design that comes along with it. There are no chaebols or rich people with shallow problems in this show. Most of the people are dirt poor and work their fingers to the bone to survive. They have true grit and their hardships form tight bonds between the characters. The setting reflects this beautifully as all the locations are humble and look like actual places where working class people live and work.

The setting is also great as it fits within the larger overarching narrative of the show. &gt;!More specifically my point is that someone who is old like Hye Ja, grew up and experienced the South Korea of old when living conditions where rough and many regular people were struggling to put food on the table, and therefore would imagine their imaginary world as such too.!&lt;

(4) The different family relationships that are portrayed are simply beautiful. Although the relationship between Hye Ja and Dae Sang is really touching, the strongest out of all is the mother-daughter relationship between Hye Ja and Jung Eun. Speaking of which I think, Lee Jung Eun who plays Jung Eun puts in the best performance out of all the actors. I’ve come to like her in all the dramas I’ve seen with her because she always rocks it with her ability to do both serious and comedy roles.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) Although the acting is good from the main cast and they each have a few stand out scenes, none of them blew me away. Han Jimin as the young Kim Hye Ja did well enough with the screen time she got. Nam Joo Hyuk as Hye Ja’s love interest Lee Joon Ha did better than he usually does but was helped out a fair bit in his difficult scenes with some really good writing carrying him a bit. Son Ho Jun as Hye Ja’s brother Kim Young Soo does fairly well with a relatively flat character, giving him some charm. Kim Hye Ja as the old Kim Hye Ja puts up a really solid and experienced performance. Overall, there is that little extra something missing from taking these good performances to great performances.

(2) The show is incredibly slow for the most part. If you imagine a show with average pacing is paced like a light jog, then this drama is a slow crawl. I understand that it is to match how slow Hye Ja has become once she has grown old but it’s not a very pleasant viewing experience. Plot points keep repeating which makes sense within the context of the show but it does not make for an interesting watch when you are left with deja vu every fifteen minutes, thinking “wait, didn’t I just watch this happen last episode?” You could skip past multiple episodes in the middle section of the drama and not be missing out on a lot of important plot information. At least the show runners made a good call by making this drama 12 episodes instead of 16, which would have slowed down the pace even further.

(3) The whole point of the majority of the show is that it’s supposed to not make sense. They have a good plot reason for it but it still is frustrating for the viewer at times. The very first inconsistency was the writers changing how the magical clock worked against what was already established. At first, Hye Ja could determine the amount of time that she could rewind and the amount of time that she lived through multiple times corresponded with her aging process, which I found really clever. Then they decided to uproot the established powers of the watch altogether when she enters the time loop. This all gets an explanation towards the end of the show, but by then the viewer has already grown annoyed at all the plot points that do not make sense. Sometimes, however, they make great use of the whole nonsensical backdrop through some hilarious scenes such as &gt;!the whole uprising of the elderly against the scamming elderly center.!&lt;

(4) To get the full experience of this drama, you have to watch it one time without being spoiled and then you have to rewatch it with all the knowledge at hand that you learn from your first watch-through. This might be way too much time to invest for most viewers especially as it is not the most viewer friendly drama to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 7,5 / 10* \- It’s a very nice drama to analyze and pick apart. However, the first time viewing experience wasn’t all that great due to the slow pace, repeating plot points and the fact that most of the show is written intentionally to not make sense.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Item - MBC**

Fantasy crime thriller drama about items with mysterious magical powers and the people who wield them.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The opening works great as a hook to get the viewers invested in the show. It shows that they spent a fair bit of time and effort on getting the opening to be polished and eye catching.

(2) The set design is actually really cool for the most part. There is a good blend of physical sets and CGI backgrounds which make for intriguing scenery in a lot of scenes. This is great as many of the places throughout the drama become memorable and recognizable so that the viewer is aware of where the scenes are taking place without needing many establishing shots. There is one glaring exception that comes to mind and it is this abomination of a magic castle that looks like it is straight out of a Playstation game when seen up close. Otherwise, the creators did a good job with the sets and the backgrounds.

(3) I never thought I would make a parallel between these two series given the difference in quality, but the profiling scenes in the show are really cool in how they are shot and visualized, and it reminds me of the profiling scenes in Stranger (2017).

(4) Some of the special effects themselves look really good. All the particle effects they use for face swapping and sucking someone’s soul out look really good for drama standards.

(5) Some of the acting performances are pretty good. Kim Min Kyo who plays the inmate Bang Hak Jae only has a minor part but radiates more charisma than anyone else on the show. Lee Jung Hyun who plays the gangster Go Dae Soo also shows off some acting prowess. Everyone else is decent except for the the first and second female lead whose acting is really dull especially when they have to play against each other in the same scene.

(6) The soundtrack is pretty good and fits the series well. It’s by no means the best soundtrack of the year but it definitely gets the job done.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

I’m going to be completely honest. This is the worst drama I have ever seen. As I didn’t want that to be a baseless accusation, I tried to go to the bottom of why I really cannot stand it.

(1) This drama is a very good example of a production being in way over their heads. The premise is really cool but the project is way too ambitious for what they are working with. I actually took the time to sit down and read the original webtoon also called “Item” that the drama is based on to find out if it is any better. There is no translation of it so it took me a while since my Korean could definitely be better, but I got through it. I can confidently say that the story is more suited to the pages of a comic. This didn’t need an adaptation and the adaptation does not do the source material justice.

Usually, this type of a story is usually a bit of an adaptation nightmare. Just look at how many superhero movies have been complete trainwrecks for Hollywood productions to adapt from the comic books. Yes, there are movies from the MCU and Nolan’s Batman that are excellent, but there is also a fair share of Fantastic Four, Affleck’s Daredevil and plenty of other misses. This is despite Hollywood’s astronomical resources and budgets. Now imagine having to make an equally difficult adaptation, but needing to produce a 16 hour long series, in a shorter timespan, with less resource. That is how you end up with a product like MBC’s Item.

(2) This show starts off decently, albeit a little slow, but soon goes off the tracks really quickly as they just keep introducing more and more magical items with different effects. The powers of some items are extremely inconsistent and suddenly do something completely different from what has already been established, simply because it is convenient.

(3) The conflict between the hero and the villain is poorly written. The antagonist is just way too overpowered. At the same time he is also poorly developed. A properly developed antagonist character has more character depth than being extremely strong and a more complex motivation than being really mean. Good thing the protagonist has the strongest plot armor ever. He can be bleeding out of his mouth due to damaged internal organs and not go to the hospital and walk around like nothing ever happened a couple of hours later. Seems legit. Most of the time when he is in a sticky situation he gets out of it through a deus ex machina; for instance, someone completely unintroduced showing up with powers that haven’t been established in the middle of nowhere on a country road no matter how unlikely it seems.

(4) The editing and direction of some of the action scenes is really rough. It’s hard to follow character positions, what is really going on and who is doing what due to poor planning in either the form of choreography, storyboarding and direction as well as poor execution in either camera work or the editing process.

For a fantasy series with a lot of potential for cool battles with mysterious magic, there is very little of that and a lot of gunfights. On top of that, there is a lack of understanding how guns work, resulting in some poor looking gun-firing scenes. For one, they rarely add a muzzle flash for when a gun is shot. The choreography of the people being shot looks quite clumsy and awkward as they just kind of stumble backwards. No one ever cocks their weapon as they apparently all run around with their weapons with the safety off. We never see shell casing pop out off a firearm even though multiple shots are fired. On top of that, we see the usual problems that film encounters with firearms. The weapons barely have any recoil. Ammunition is never a problem. Everyone fires non-suppressed guns without ear protection. I don’t expect full realism, I just want the filmmakers to try somewhat when they make a action series involving guns. In this drama, they just didn’t care and there is no good plot reason for the guns to be completely unrealistic like for instance being in a computer world, such as in The Matrix (1999).

(5) Some of the special effects are a bit poorly executed which results in them breaking the immersion quite a bit. The largest problem regarding the special effects is with lighting and shadows. Things that are computer generated that emit light should act like a real light source and spread light on the surroundings and make objects cast shadows. It isn’t enough to just generate the object you want on screen digitally, you also have to generate the effects the object has on its surroundings.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 3,0 / 10* \- This drama ended up being pretty terrible as the show makers tried to create a show that was way too difficult to execute for what they were working with.

&amp;#x200B;

**---**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Fiery Priest - SBS**

Action comedy drama about a priest out to punish all the wrong doers of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Good:*

(1) The acting is pretty good. Kim Nam Gil and Kim Sung Kyun are pretty good in their roles as priest Kim Hae Il and detective Go Dae Young, and get to show some acting range. Ahn Chang Wan and Go Kyu Pil make up a really hilarious duo as Song Sac, the Thai guy with a huge heart and Yo Han, the convenience store part timer with a degree in astrophysics. Shoutout also to Geum Sae Rok doing a pretty decent job as newly hired detective Seo Seung Ah considering she is a rookie actress.

(2) There is character development to some degree. For example, detective Go Dae Young learns that it’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees &gt;!and eventually goes back to fighting injustice like he once did.!&lt;

(3) The back half of this show is way better than the first half. It feels like the entire production got a lot more comfortable and the quality definitely improved over time. The writing gets tighter, the actors get more accustomed to their roles and the humour started hitting the mark a lot more often by abandoning the attempts to achieve laughs by screaming and instead upping the wackiness factor.

(4) I respect the decision not to go down the path of any potential romance plots. Not every drama needs a romance main plot or sub plot and considering that 72% of dramas listed in 2018 has a romance tag attached to it, it’s rather refreshing to see a pretty light hearted show not opt for any romance stories.

&amp;#x200B;

*The Bad:*

(1) The drama is lacking in both direction and writing, which can be attributed to the people spearheading the production. This drama is from the director of the tragic Fashion King, Lee Myung Woo and the hit or miss writer Park Jae Bum, who wrote the poorly written Blood along with some good dramas like Chief Kim. There are actually some similarities between this and Chief Kim but The Fiery Priest lacks some of the charisma that Chief Kim had, possibly due to the lack of Namgoong Min. Overall, the combination of these two as lead creators results in the drama lacking focus, being predictable, and relying way too heavily on cheap gags instead of any more elaborate humor.

(2) The tone of the drama is everywhere. It goes from being very serious one moment to being a silly comedy the next. Now some people may enjoy that style, for me it just creates cognitive dissonance. These types of jarring tonal shifts, where a show switches between a wacky comedy with cartoony visual and sound effects and serious crime drama, are really hard to execute in my opinion, and I don’t really think they succeeded with it in this show. The drama tries to deal with serious topics such as PTSD, xenophobia, corruption, (alleged) suicide and molestation within the Catholic church. However, all of this gets buried under the wacky humour. The serious bits also take away from the humour as the viewer is not inclined to laugh right after having seen a tragic scene such as&gt;!seeing a dozen kids being blown to pieces by a hand grenade.!&lt;

(3) Although there is a lot of fighting in this show that is pretty well choreographed, especially the scenes of former junior martial arts athlete Go Joon, it barely ever carries any consequences which makes the fighting feel rather pointless. An important character can beaten nearly to death and the next day run around like they are fine unless the plot requires them to die/end up in a coma. It severely lowers the stakes of the serious action scenes, while at the same brutal scenes of violence impedes the notion that the series is supposed to be funny. Then again, maybe we are not supposed to take the violent scenes seriously considering the makeup work to recreate injuries looks almost cartoony. Real bruises don’t turn blue right after an injury, it takes around 24 hours for it to go from red to blue.

(4) The plot takes a long time to really get going. The main arc of the drama &gt;!which is the team fully gathered up and standing against the bad guys!&lt; starts taking place around 13 hours into the drama. The writer put a lot of obstacles in the way of plot progression and almost all of them can be explained with “corruption”. They use corruption as a constant be-all and end-all solution to ensure that the protagonist makes no progress. There is no need for this drama to be 40 episodes each spanning 30 minutes. Some tighter writing could have easily cut this 20 hour drama into a 16 or even 12 hour drama.

&amp;#x200B;

*Score: 6,5 / 10* \- This is not going to be a popular score with the majority and to be honest, this is one of those dramas that I understand the appeal of for other people, but I don’t see it’s greatness myself. The first half hovered somewhere around a 5 for me while the back half was closer to an 8. Overall, I feel like a 6,5 is a fair score for me personally. However, I do acknowledge that this drama is probably going to be very influential on a lot of upcoming kdramas due to its immense popularity in Korea.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to the other parts of the series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next part of the review series is here! To start of with, I’d like to thank everyone for the love and support that Part 1 got which has motivated me to keep writing. I wouldn’t be doing these posts if not for this lovely community. For additional info about what this series of posts is, who I am, what my intentions are with these posts, spoilers and spoiler tags as well as my scoring, I refer to the introduction to Part 1 of the series that is linked above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get started with Part 2, I would like to say a few things. Compared to January, I don’t think the dramas that were released in February were as strong. As a result there are quite a few negative and lukewarm reviews in this post. I know I am not going to make myself popular by putting these opinions out there but I feel it would be disingenuous to say I think a drama is better than what I actually think just to have a more favorable reception. As usual, I will argue why I have said opinions of a certain show and I encourage you lovely people to argue against me if you think my stance or score is unfair. Just to make it clear, I don’t rate shows averagely because I hate kdramas. It’s rather the opposite, I love kdramas, otherwise I wouldn’t be putting so much effort into these posts. Since I love kdramas, I want to shine light on what I think is really good, and if I were to give everything a great score then that would devalue what I think are the actually great shows. I will be returning to form with more positive reviews for the March post, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that being said, let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Your Heart - TvN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romcom drama about an attorney and a movie star who find unexpected love when opposites attract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The hype surrounding these two main leads coming together once again was immense, but even though expectations were sky high, I think they both lived up to the hype. Yes, obviously their characters are different from their previous drama Goblin, since this is a different series, yet the characters and the actors’ performances are great in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoo In Na’s portrayal of Oh Yun Seo is great. This is not her first time portraying an actress on screen and there have been many comparisons between Oh Yun Seo and her roles in Queen In Hyun’s Man and My Love From The Stars as well as fellow actress Jun Ji Hyun’s character from said drama. Yet, the presentation of Oh Yun Seo feels distinctly different and charming on its own. Even though she is childish, airheaded and naive, the audience quickly comes to root for Yun Seo as she is genuine, cute and very human. Lee Dong Wook as the lawyer Kwon Jung Rok is no slouch either as he put up a really good performance. At first he comes off as cold and unfriendly but we soon learn that he is upstanding, caring and sweet. Both of the actors manage to display great duality in their characters showing us that there are many sides to a person and that first impressions aren’t everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The contrast between the two main lead characters are shown throughout the different aspects of the drama, even down to the set design. Oh Yun Seo’s apartment and desk is bright, cute, fluffy and playful. Kwon Jung Rok’s apartment and desk is traditional, serious, toned down and functional. It truly feels like these characters work and live in these spaces and have made them their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Despite how enjoyable both the leads are to watch, the best acting performance of the drama definitely belongs to Kim Dae Gon who plays a butcher’s son with a mental disability and does so in a convincing fashion. He really sells it with his portrayal of a naive and neurotic man who ends up in a lot of trouble regardless of his good intentions. Along with him and many others, the supporting cast are for the most part quite charismatic and memorable. Each character has their own quirks and add either humor or weight to the drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I really like the camera movement of this drama and also the times at which they chose to incorporate camera movement. The camera movement is smooth in the use of zooms, pans, tilts, trucking, dollies and pedestals. Better yet, the movement rarely feels overused or like it’s something that was thrown in just for visual interest. Sometimes, just having a stationary shot creates a more pleasant viewing and allows the actor to really pierce through the screen, which creates more emotion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Besides just the camera movement, many other aspects of how the drama was shot is also really well done. I really like how a lot of interactions between our main leads are filmed. Instead of just relying on over-shoulder-shots for much of their conversations, the director often uses two-shots of them in either a full shot size or ¾ shot size. At the beginning it emphasises on how standoffish their relationship is whereas later on it emphasises their romantic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another really creative thing that the director does in the drama is to use character positions as visual indicators. This allows for group conversations to be filmed without constantly establishing the speaker with a close up, instead it becomes apparent who is speaking through who is leaning forward or somehow has a position that sets them aside from non-speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama falls into a lot of clichés and is often predictable. You know what you are going to get and that is both a strength and a weakness. Some people might find this drama to be überfluff and just way too sweet and cutesy, but fortunately for me, I have a sweet tooth. It is directed by the same person who directed “What’s Wrong With Secretary Kim”, which shares the same fluffy feel-good romcom formula. I believe that formula is quite polarizing and will draw some viewers in while pushing other viewers out. The premise is not something very unique either considering it is one of the many office romance dramas to air this year where the man is the boss and the woman is his subordinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Sometimes the characters act out of character just to create tension and drama. The most noticeable instance of this happening is &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;during episode 13 when the drama decides to incorporate the frustrating noble idiocy trope. Characters who once had great trust and communication suddenly stop talking and decide to be angsty by themselves, leading to great frustration for the viewer and inconsistent characterization.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Some of the subplots are just not that well thought out or executed. As it mostly takes place at Always Law Firm, this drama does have several legal plots and although I’m not an attorney, I can say that the courtroom scenes are not very believable and sometimes lack proper logic or courtroom etiquette. To be fair, this is expected from pretty much all kdramas that are not specifically legal dramas though, but the execution could absolutely have been better. There are two ways that it could have been solved, either invest time into better research and writing for these scenes or go more over-the-top with them to make them humorous and not to be taken seriously. Furthermore, there are subplots that go nowhere and are not very well structured such as the whole plot line about the creepy stalker of Oh Yun Seo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my proficiency in Korean is only of the level that my regular intake of writing mostly consists of webcomics and children’s books, I haven’t read the web novel “Jinsimi Dadda” from which the story is adapted. Thus, I do not know if the flaws in the show’s writing comes from the screenwriter or just as a product of making a faithful adaptation. Therefore, I will not comment on that matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 8,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It is not a very deep or original drama, but it doesn’t try to be that either. It executes what it’s going for pretty well and I think the great acting, set design and camera work justifies the score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trap - OCN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crime thriller drama about a family man who ends up involved with a group of people who enjoy hunting humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The plot is really gritty and has a lot of twists and turns. No character feels like they are safe and it truly feels like anything can happen. Important characters get killed or have their lives ruined without warning. It’s one of those dramas that grabs your full attention with its thriller elements. The thriller elements in combination with the series only having 7 episodes makes for a perfect series to binge-watch it in one sitting. The drama doesn’t have room to drag or get boring. As a result of only having 7 episodes, it feels pretty tightly written. Not once throughout the show’s runtime did I feel myself getting disinterested in the story. Despite being very thrilling, Trap doesn’t fall into the Michael Bay category of just being high octane constantly which ultimately feels flat. Trap had its quiet moments too which allows it to build up to the climactic scenes and the suspense become more tangible than in a series that just puts the pedal the metal and never lets go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) Sung Dong Il is a really good actor as always. In Trap, he plays detective Go Dong Kook who is close to retiring but decides to take on one last case. Sung Dong Il has almost 30 years of acting experience and you can really tell. Due to his age he rarely gets main roles in Kdramas nowadays and is often cast as a side character. Therefore, it is really refreshing to see him get so much spotlight in the role of a main character next to Lee Seo Jin who plays Kang Woo Hyun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) In the context of a kdrama, the story and premise is quite unique. There is some good usage of metaphors with the whole hunting and trap motif that runs throughout the story. The metaphor is referred to in the background even, such as when Go Dong Kook is in the museum and the guide is talking about how humans evolved to invent tools that allowed us to become hunters. This acts as foreshadowing to the twisted hunting group that think they have evolved further than the rest of humanity and they use this logic to justify their hunting of other humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The cinematography is mostly really good. They do a good job with keeping the eyelines lined up correctly even in scenes that are more complex. They use some pretty cool drone shots sweeping over the landscape showing of the setting and having the added bonus of looking really gorgeous as the scenery is filled with autumn forests and winding country roads. Some crane shots are also used in the show in order to extend shots that would otherwise have required multiple cuts, which creates great momentum and fluidity. Even some of the handheld camera movement is surprisingly solid in the sense that it doesn’t involve too much shaky cam and it tracks the character movement well keeping them in frame but with enough space to allow for you to see actions that happens around them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama tries to execute a really difficult way of storytelling and it doesn’t work out very well as the execution of said technique is just so hard. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;In my opinion, executing a plot twist which involves an unreliable narrator is so hard to get right in cinematic form, as opposed to in a novel. The reason for this is because in a drama or a movie, the filmmakers have to show us shots that the unreliable narrator possibly couldn&amp;#39;t have known about or been apart of, such as other characters actions and dialogue or establishing shots when the narrator is not on screen. This makes the viewer feel cheated since the producers show us additional lies that the narrator is not telling us. I just felt like the series crumbled when they couldn&amp;#39;t execute this properly, which I don&amp;#39;t blame them for since it is very difficult to do. One sign of a plot twist being really good is that it adds to the rewatch value of the show, but with the plot twist of this show you don’t get the satisfaction of seeing the puzzle come together upon a rewatch as the twist is just ”I lied”. The ”I lied” twist can be used in an interesting way such as seen in Primal Fear (1996), but one main error that Trap commits is that it explicitly explains all of its misdirections to us rather than letting the audience discover these for themselves either by thinking back on the show or upon a rewatch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) I also felt like the filmmakers tried to be dark for the sake of being dark rather than for plot reasons, which comes of as a bit pretentious and overly edgy to me. But hey, to each their own, we all have different standards for what comes off as trying to hard. One of the most important aspects when writing a dark story is to write morally grey characters that have proper motivations for doing bad things so that the viewers can understand the characters actions. A prototypical example of this would be Walter White from Breaking Bad (2008) who turns to selling meth but has understandable motivations for doing so since he has cancer and needs to take care of his family. Among Korean series, Stranger (2017) would be a great example of an ensemble of well written morally ambiguous characters with proper motivations. The motivations of killing and doing bad deeds in Trap mostly just stop at ”I do it because I’m a psychopath”, which applies to the majority of the cast, except for the two main characters &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;who are looking for revenge even though Kang Woo Hyun does it because he is a psychopath as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The way they tried to wrap up the ending was quite disappointing. There are way too many plot threads left hanging. I don’t mind setting up for a sequel if that is what they are going for, but that should be done with some tact. Make sure to finish the current arc and then you can throw out a bit of teaser in the vane of ”it’s not over yet”. In this drama they just abandoned the first main arc of the story about 90% done and then called it a day. There are no signs of a season 2 ever happening either which results in a pretty unsatisfying situation as the viewer doesn’t get any closure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) There are some really crappy visual effects in this drama. For instance, the fire in the opening scene is painful to look at. The flames are so obviously added in digitally through post production as you can tell they are on a different layer than the physical scene, there is some artifacting on the flames, the movement of the flames is predictable since they are animated and there is little to no smoke added in digitally to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - The concept for this drama is excellent and it’s accompanied by good actors and cinematography but the poor effects and especially the writing hiccups impacted the drama quite negatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Light in Your Eyes - JTBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melodrama with elements of romance and comedy about a woman who has the ability to turn back time but at the price of growing old. The drama showcases the joys and hardships of growing old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The choreography is really strong throughout the drama. They have probably the nicest shots of scenery and nature out of all the dramas of the year so far. From the lonely bus stop at night which we’ve all cried at once or twice in our lives, to the waves crashing in on the sandy beach while seagulls flock above, this drama is filled with eye candy that really fits each scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also use plenty of creative camera angles. I am weak for angles in which they film from within different confined space which then frames the character on the outside of the confined space. Thus, one of my favorite shots happen early on when the mischievous Young Soo reaches in under the sink after a portable grill and he almost touches the camera as the scene is being filmed from under the sink. It’s just such a cool and creative camera angle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The ending of episode 10. It’s impossible to talk about this drama without talking about this part of the show. If you haven’t watched the show and don’t want to get spoiled, just skip to the next talking point, just know that this episode is one of the most impactful episodes of this year. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;This plot twist changes everything about the drama and explains a lot of the intentionally written plot points that do not make sense. The chronology and the lack of realism is all explained by Hye Ja actually being a patient with Alzheimer’s disease. The twist is the key that unlocks the drama and allows you to fully understand all the confusing moments that were brought about earlier in the drama. This type of a twist where the events of the plots are all part of an imaginary world was popularized by the short story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (1890) by Ambrose Bierce. As the story gets more incoherent and more and more unlikely events take place, the reader/viewer starts to realize that something fishy is going on. What is really going on behind the scenes is masked by memories that are all distorted and mixed up until the final reveal when it becomes clear that the rest of the story is just the memories of a person at the end of their lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;This type of a twist operates very similarly to the ”it was all a dream” type twists in that much of the film took part outside of the ”real world”. This sort of a twist can be quite controversial as when it’s executed poorly it leaves the viewer with a sense that they wasted their time. However, it can be used to great effect, which I think is the case for The Light in Your Eyes. As far as cinema goes probably the best example of a well executed ”it was all a dream” twists can be found in the classic movie ”The Wizard of Oz” (1939), paving the way by showing that this twist can be used to achieve other purposes other than as an easy out for writers who have written themselves into a corner. In both stories, the dream experiences are used to cope with their respective main characters’ problems. As for Hye Ja, she gets to experience an existence wherein she saves her son (or father in the dream) from an accident that crippled him, which is a sort of trigger for her as indicated by that incident being what made her imagine herself as her real age even in her visions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I really enjoy the setting and all the set design that comes along with it. There are no chaebols or rich people with shallow problems in this show. Most of the people are dirt poor and work their fingers to the bone to survive. They have true grit and their hardships form tight bonds between the characters. The setting reflects this beautifully as all the locations are humble and look like actual places where working class people live and work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting is also great as it fits within the larger overarching narrative of the show. &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;More specifically my point is that someone who is old like Hye Ja, grew up and experienced the South Korea of old when living conditions where rough and many regular people were struggling to put food on the table, and therefore would imagine their imaginary world as such too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The different family relationships that are portrayed are simply beautiful. Although the relationship between Hye Ja and Dae Sang is really touching, the strongest out of all is the mother-daughter relationship between Hye Ja and Jung Eun. Speaking of which I think, Lee Jung Eun who plays Jung Eun puts in the best performance out of all the actors. I’ve come to like her in all the dramas I’ve seen with her because she always rocks it with her ability to do both serious and comedy roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) Although the acting is good from the main cast and they each have a few stand out scenes, none of them blew me away. Han Jimin as the young Kim Hye Ja did well enough with the screen time she got. Nam Joo Hyuk as Hye Ja’s love interest Lee Joon Ha did better than he usually does but was helped out a fair bit in his difficult scenes with some really good writing carrying him a bit. Son Ho Jun as Hye Ja’s brother Kim Young Soo does fairly well with a relatively flat character, giving him some charm. Kim Hye Ja as the old Kim Hye Ja puts up a really solid and experienced performance. Overall, there is that little extra something missing from taking these good performances to great performances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The show is incredibly slow for the most part. If you imagine a show with average pacing is paced like a light jog, then this drama is a slow crawl. I understand that it is to match how slow Hye Ja has become once she has grown old but it’s not a very pleasant viewing experience. Plot points keep repeating which makes sense within the context of the show but it does not make for an interesting watch when you are left with deja vu every fifteen minutes, thinking “wait, didn’t I just watch this happen last episode?” You could skip past multiple episodes in the middle section of the drama and not be missing out on a lot of important plot information. At least the show runners made a good call by making this drama 12 episodes instead of 16, which would have slowed down the pace even further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The whole point of the majority of the show is that it’s supposed to not make sense. They have a good plot reason for it but it still is frustrating for the viewer at times. The very first inconsistency was the writers changing how the magical clock worked against what was already established. At first, Hye Ja could determine the amount of time that she could rewind and the amount of time that she lived through multiple times corresponded with her aging process, which I found really clever. Then they decided to uproot the established powers of the watch altogether when she enters the time loop. This all gets an explanation towards the end of the show, but by then the viewer has already grown annoyed at all the plot points that do not make sense. Sometimes, however, they make great use of the whole nonsensical backdrop through some hilarious scenes such as &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;the whole uprising of the elderly against the scamming elderly center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) To get the full experience of this drama, you have to watch it one time without being spoiled and then you have to rewatch it with all the knowledge at hand that you learn from your first watch-through. This might be way too much time to invest for most viewers especially as it is not the most viewer friendly drama to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 7,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - It’s a very nice drama to analyze and pick apart. However, the first time viewing experience wasn’t all that great due to the slow pace, repeating plot points and the fact that most of the show is written intentionally to not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Item - MBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fantasy crime thriller drama about items with mysterious magical powers and the people who wield them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The opening works great as a hook to get the viewers invested in the show. It shows that they spent a fair bit of time and effort on getting the opening to be polished and eye catching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The set design is actually really cool for the most part. There is a good blend of physical sets and CGI backgrounds which make for intriguing scenery in a lot of scenes. This is great as many of the places throughout the drama become memorable and recognizable so that the viewer is aware of where the scenes are taking place without needing many establishing shots. There is one glaring exception that comes to mind and it is this abomination of a magic castle that looks like it is straight out of a Playstation game when seen up close. Otherwise, the creators did a good job with the sets and the backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) I never thought I would make a parallel between these two series given the difference in quality, but the profiling scenes in the show are really cool in how they are shot and visualized, and it reminds me of the profiling scenes in Stranger (2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) Some of the special effects themselves look really good. All the particle effects they use for face swapping and sucking someone’s soul out look really good for drama standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Some of the acting performances are pretty good. Kim Min Kyo who plays the inmate Bang Hak Jae only has a minor part but radiates more charisma than anyone else on the show. Lee Jung Hyun who plays the gangster Go Dae Soo also shows off some acting prowess. Everyone else is decent except for the the first and second female lead whose acting is really dull especially when they have to play against each other in the same scene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(6) The soundtrack is pretty good and fits the series well. It’s by no means the best soundtrack of the year but it definitely gets the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be completely honest. This is the worst drama I have ever seen. As I didn’t want that to be a baseless accusation, I tried to go to the bottom of why I really cannot stand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) This drama is a very good example of a production being in way over their heads. The premise is really cool but the project is way too ambitious for what they are working with. I actually took the time to sit down and read the original webtoon also called “Item” that the drama is based on to find out if it is any better. There is no translation of it so it took me a while since my Korean could definitely be better, but I got through it. I can confidently say that the story is more suited to the pages of a comic. This didn’t need an adaptation and the adaptation does not do the source material justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, this type of a story is usually a bit of an adaptation nightmare. Just look at how many superhero movies have been complete trainwrecks for Hollywood productions to adapt from the comic books. Yes, there are movies from the MCU and Nolan’s Batman that are excellent, but there is also a fair share of Fantastic Four, Affleck’s Daredevil and plenty of other misses. This is despite Hollywood’s astronomical resources and budgets. Now imagine having to make an equally difficult adaptation, but needing to produce a 16 hour long series, in a shorter timespan, with less resource. That is how you end up with a product like MBC’s Item.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) This show starts off decently, albeit a little slow, but soon goes off the tracks really quickly as they just keep introducing more and more magical items with different effects. The powers of some items are extremely inconsistent and suddenly do something completely different from what has already been established, simply because it is convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The conflict between the hero and the villain is poorly written. The antagonist is just way too overpowered. At the same time he is also poorly developed. A properly developed antagonist character has more character depth than being extremely strong and a more complex motivation than being really mean. Good thing the protagonist has the strongest plot armor ever. He can be bleeding out of his mouth due to damaged internal organs and not go to the hospital and walk around like nothing ever happened a couple of hours later. Seems legit. Most of the time when he is in a sticky situation he gets out of it through a deus ex machina; for instance, someone completely unintroduced showing up with powers that haven’t been established in the middle of nowhere on a country road no matter how unlikely it seems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The editing and direction of some of the action scenes is really rough. It’s hard to follow character positions, what is really going on and who is doing what due to poor planning in either the form of choreography, storyboarding and direction as well as poor execution in either camera work or the editing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a fantasy series with a lot of potential for cool battles with mysterious magic, there is very little of that and a lot of gunfights. On top of that, there is a lack of understanding how guns work, resulting in some poor looking gun-firing scenes. For one, they rarely add a muzzle flash for when a gun is shot. The choreography of the people being shot looks quite clumsy and awkward as they just kind of stumble backwards. No one ever cocks their weapon as they apparently all run around with their weapons with the safety off. We never see shell casing pop out off a firearm even though multiple shots are fired. On top of that, we see the usual problems that film encounters with firearms. The weapons barely have any recoil. Ammunition is never a problem. Everyone fires non-suppressed guns without ear protection. I don’t expect full realism, I just want the filmmakers to try somewhat when they make a action series involving guns. In this drama, they just didn’t care and there is no good plot reason for the guns to be completely unrealistic like for instance being in a computer world, such as in The Matrix (1999).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(5) Some of the special effects are a bit poorly executed which results in them breaking the immersion quite a bit. The largest problem regarding the special effects is with lighting and shadows. Things that are computer generated that emit light should act like a real light source and spread light on the surroundings and make objects cast shadows. It isn’t enough to just generate the object you want on screen digitally, you also have to generate the effects the object has on its surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 3,0 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This drama ended up being pretty terrible as the show makers tried to create a show that was way too difficult to execute for what they were working with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;---&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fiery Priest - SBS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action comedy drama about a priest out to punish all the wrong doers of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Good:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The acting is pretty good. Kim Nam Gil and Kim Sung Kyun are pretty good in their roles as priest Kim Hae Il and detective Go Dae Young, and get to show some acting range. Ahn Chang Wan and Go Kyu Pil make up a really hilarious duo as Song Sac, the Thai guy with a huge heart and Yo Han, the convenience store part timer with a degree in astrophysics. Shoutout also to Geum Sae Rok doing a pretty decent job as newly hired detective Seo Seung Ah considering she is a rookie actress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) There is character development to some degree. For example, detective Go Dae Young learns that it’s better to die on your feet than to live on your knees &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;and eventually goes back to fighting injustice like he once did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) The back half of this show is way better than the first half. It feels like the entire production got a lot more comfortable and the quality definitely improved over time. The writing gets tighter, the actors get more accustomed to their roles and the humour started hitting the mark a lot more often by abandoning the attempts to achieve laughs by screaming and instead upping the wackiness factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) I respect the decision not to go down the path of any potential romance plots. Not every drama needs a romance main plot or sub plot and considering that 72% of dramas listed in 2018 has a romance tag attached to it, it’s rather refreshing to see a pretty light hearted show not opt for any romance stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bad:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) The drama is lacking in both direction and writing, which can be attributed to the people spearheading the production. This drama is from the director of the tragic Fashion King, Lee Myung Woo and the hit or miss writer Park Jae Bum, who wrote the poorly written Blood along with some good dramas like Chief Kim. There are actually some similarities between this and Chief Kim but The Fiery Priest lacks some of the charisma that Chief Kim had, possibly due to the lack of Namgoong Min. Overall, the combination of these two as lead creators results in the drama lacking focus, being predictable, and relying way too heavily on cheap gags instead of any more elaborate humor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(2) The tone of the drama is everywhere. It goes from being very serious one moment to being a silly comedy the next. Now some people may enjoy that style, for me it just creates cognitive dissonance. These types of jarring tonal shifts, where a show switches between a wacky comedy with cartoony visual and sound effects and serious crime drama, are really hard to execute in my opinion, and I don’t really think they succeeded with it in this show. The drama tries to deal with serious topics such as PTSD, xenophobia, corruption, (alleged) suicide and molestation within the Catholic church. However, all of this gets buried under the wacky humour. The serious bits also take away from the humour as the viewer is not inclined to laugh right after having seen a tragic scene such as&lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;seeing a dozen kids being blown to pieces by a hand grenade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(3) Although there is a lot of fighting in this show that is pretty well choreographed, especially the scenes of former junior martial arts athlete Go Joon, it barely ever carries any consequences which makes the fighting feel rather pointless. An important character can beaten nearly to death and the next day run around like they are fine unless the plot requires them to die/end up in a coma. It severely lowers the stakes of the serious action scenes, while at the same brutal scenes of violence impedes the notion that the series is supposed to be funny. Then again, maybe we are not supposed to take the violent scenes seriously considering the makeup work to recreate injuries looks almost cartoony. Real bruises don’t turn blue right after an injury, it takes around 24 hours for it to go from red to blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(4) The plot takes a long time to really get going. The main arc of the drama &lt;span class=""md-spoiler-text""&gt;which is the team fully gathered up and standing against the bad guys&lt;/span&gt; starts taking place around 13 hours into the drama. The writer put a lot of obstacles in the way of plot progression and almost all of them can be explained with “corruption”. They use corruption as a constant be-all and end-all solution to ensure that the protagonist makes no progress. There is no need for this drama to be 40 episodes each spanning 30 minutes. Some tighter writing could have easily cut this 20 hour drama into a 16 or even 12 hour drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Score: 6,5 / 10&lt;/em&gt; - This is not going to be a popular score with the majority and to be honest, this is one of those dramas that I understand the appeal of for other people, but I don’t see it’s greatness myself. The first half hovered somewhere around a 5 for me while the back half was closer to an 8. Overall, I feel like a 6,5 is a fair score for me personally. However, I do acknowledge that this drama is probably going to be very influential on a lot of upcoming kdramas due to its immense popularity in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

**On-Air Policy Clarification:**

* Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It's a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what's going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it's best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There's no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That's where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!

* Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines).

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Rules&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find them in our wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/rules""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Policies&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are available in the wiki &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/kdrama/wiki/policies""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and in the Rules &amp;amp; Policies section of the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Air Policy Clarification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sending a modmail or a message has never been about asking for permission. It&amp;#39;s a simple heads up type of message so the mods can add the info to the Current On-Air Drama Discussion section of the sidebar. Mods might not catch new posts and it can take a while to realize what&amp;#39;s going on. Popular dramas generate a lot of buzz and it&amp;#39;s best to keep the subreddit neat by having one weekly discussion for a drama as it is airing in Korea. There&amp;#39;s no need to have three people hosting separate discussions of the same type. That&amp;#39;s where the notification comes in. You are more than welcome to host the weekly discussion with other subscribers in case scheduling is a problem. Just let us know, please!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are including all the info you can. The guidelines on that can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/episodediscussionguidelines""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Ratings&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to know if your current on-air drama is a hit? Want to know how the other dramas are doing? Check our ratings wiki page &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/drama_ratings""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. There are a few sites listed to get you started. You can also rate past dramas in the Google survey form linked there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;General Tips and Tricks&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can use Kakao Talk emotes in this subreddit? The guide can be found &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/comments/2kpnap/lets_kakaotalk/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please make sure you are using spoiler tags when discussing important plot details and other information. You can find the guide &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/spoilertags""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like italics, headings, and table formatting are done using markdown. You can find the guide &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/KDRAMA/wiki/formatting_and_markdown""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
